    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Clemens Lamping</span>, the author of the first part of this little volume,
    is a young lieutenant in the Oldenburg service, who, tired of the
    monotonous life of a garrison, resigned his commission in July, 1839,
    and went to Spain to win his spurs under Espartero. Unfortunately he
    was detained by contrary winds, and arrived just as the treaty of
    Bergara had put an end to the war.
  </p>

  <p>
    After spending six months at Madrid in abortive attempts to join
    the army in Arragon, then the seat of war, he resolved to go to
    Africa, and take part in the French crusade against the infidels.
    He accordingly went to Cadiz, encountering many adventures on his
    way through La Mancha and Andaluzia, and thence to Algiers, where he
    entered the foreign legion as a volunteer.
  </p>

  <p>
    After two years of danger and hardship, the author returned to
    Oldenburg, having lost many illusions, and gained some experience.
    His sovereign restored him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span> his former grade in the service of
    Oldenburg, where he sits at his ease by his own fireside, and relates
    his adventures to his friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lieutenant Lamping’s Reminiscences are followed by the abridgement
    of a narrative of five months’ captivity among the Arabs, by M. de
    France, a lieutenant in the French navy. The author modestly assures
    his readers that he is better skilled in the management of a ship than
    of his pen, and that his book would never have been published but
    at the request of his friends. It has nevertheless reached a second
    edition in France.

    <span class="smcap">At</span> last, my dear friend, after so many hardships and such various
    wanderings, I have leisure to write to you; and I have much, very
    much, to tell. The events of my life have lately followed each other
    in such rapid succession, that the dangers and sorrows of the noble,
    much-enduring Odysseus, nay, even the immortal adventures of the
    valiant Knight of La Mancha, are mere child’s play in comparison with
    my own.

    Since the month of April we have scarce had time to take breath; so
    rapidly did expedition follow expedition, and <em>razzia razzia</em>. The
    new Governor, Bugeaud, naturally enough wishes to show that he is
    equal to his post. His predecessor, Vallée, drew upon himself the
    imputation of indolence, but no one can deny to Bugeaud the possession
    of great energy and untiring activity. He encounters the Arabs with
    their own weapons, harassing them with incessant attacks, and burning
    and plundering the whole country. We have made two very important
    expeditions; the first against Thaza, a strong fortress belonging to
    Abd-el-Kader, situated on the borders of the desert. After destroying
    this place, we returned through the iron gates (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portes de fer</i>) to
    our own camp; this expedition occupied about four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> weeks. A few days
    afterwards we started again to throw provisions into Milianah, and
    to lay waste the plains of the Chellif with fire and sword. It was
    exactly harvest time. In order to cut off from the Bedouins all means
    of existence, it was of course necessary to drive away their cattle
    and to burn their corn. Before long the whole plain looked like a sea
    of fire.
  </p>

  <p>
    These expeditions, sent out in the very hottest season of the year,
    had such an effect upon the health of the soldiers, that the Governor
    was compelled to allow them a short rest. The regiment to which
    I belonged had scarcely a third part fit for service, the other
    two-thirds were either dead or in the hospital. We were accordingly
    sent to Coleah to recruit our strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will have a tolerably correct idea of our recruiting quarters when
    I tell you that one day is passed on guard, another in reconnoitring
    the enemy for several hours, and the third in working at the dry ditch
    (a sort of <em>pendant</em> to the great wall of China) intended to defend
    the plain of the Metidja against any sudden attacks of the Hadjutes.
    I assure you, however, that we think this life vastly agreeable, and
    consider ourselves as well off as if we were in Abraham’s bosom. There
    was a time, indeed, when I should not have been quite so contented
    with my lot, but every thing is relative in this best of all possible
    worlds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coleah is a true Arab town, which stands on the south-eastern
    declivity of the Sahel range of mountains, in a charming little nook,
    and is well supplied with water.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are only twelve leagues from Algiers and about three from the sea,
    the proximity to which makes the place extremely healthy. The constant
    sea breeze renders the heat even of this season quite tolerable.
  </p>

  <p>
    At our feet is stretched the vast plain of the Metidja bounded by the
    blue hills of the lesser Atlas range. We are quartered in a fortified
    camp outside the town, on a small eminence which commands it. Of
    course all the gates of the town and the market-place are guarded by
    our troops. My leisure hours, which, indeed, are not too many, are
    generally passed in sauntering about the streets.
  </p>

  <p>
    The inhabitants of Coleah are pure descendants of the Moors, and still
    retain some traces of their former refinement; you must not confound
    them with the Bedouins and Kabyles, who always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> have been, and still
    are the lowest in point of civilisation. I have nowhere found the Arab
    so polished and so attractive as at Coleah, not even at Algiers and
    Oran; in those towns, their intercourse with the French has called
    forth all their rapacity, and spoiled the simplicity of their manners.
    It is a remarkable fact that in all these towns near the sea the
    Spanish language is still spoken, of course in a most corrupt dialect;
    a proof that some connection with Spain has constantly existed—often,
    no doubt, a very reluctant one on their parts: as in the reign of
    Charles V., who conquered great part of this coast.
  </p>

  <p>
    To me this is very welcome, as it enables me to talk with the Arabs;
    it is not however easy to enter into conversation with them, as they
    are almost always silent and reserved towards strangers. In order to
    get them to talk it is necessary first to inspire confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    All my spare time is passed in the Arab coffee-house, the resort of
    the fashion and aristocracy of Coleah, and I have already succeeded
    in making some acquaintances. I have even obtained marks of evident
    goodwill from them by my earnest and sympathising attention to
    their singers and story-tellers, who never fail to attend the best
    coffee-houses.
  </p>

  <p>
    The clerk of the Hakim (the chief magistrate) is a great friend of
    mine. He is an exceedingly well-informed man, and with you he would be
    called “Mr. Secretary.” He knows the whole Koran by heart, besides a
    host of Persian poems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like every man of sense he is exceedingly modest, lamenting his
    ignorance, and inquiring diligently into our European habits and
    manners. I have occasionally had the pleasure of seeing my friend Ben
    Jussuf (for that is his name) occupied in the fulfilment of his duties
    as clerk. Every Friday is kept by the Arabs as a holiday on which
    markets are held and judgments given. On this day the Hakim sits in
    the public place before the great coffee-house, and holds his court;
    on his right hand stands his clerk who commits his judgments to paper,
    and on his left the executioner who inflicts the punishments awarded
    by the Hakim on the spot. This generally consists in some fifty or
    hundred strokes of the bastinado, and sometimes even in death; the
    latter, however, only for political offences, such as treasonable
    correspondence with the enemy, &amp;c. Should the case be doubtful, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
    Hakim orders a certain number of strokes of the bastinado to be given
    to both parties, and takes to himself the object of contention,
    generally a sheep or a donkey—a proceeding only differing from our
    own inasmuch as it has the great advantage of being more summary.
    If any one is too profuse in his excuses, the Hakim says to the
    executioner, “Give my comrade (among the Arabs every one is a comrade)
    some thirty strokes of the bastinado, to teach him not to confuse me
    any more with his ingenious evasions.” In this country, you see, an
    advocate’s fees would not be very high.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coleah is held in great reverence by the Arabs as it contains
    Abd-el-Kader’s vault, in which are deposited the bodies of several
    members of his family. The French have spared this tomb, in
    consideration of which Abd-el-Kader has vowed never to attack the town
    or its immediate neighbourhood.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Hakim belongs to the family of the Emir, and is very rich: the
    sheath and handle of his yataghan are of pure gold, and his horses
    the finest I ever saw. He is the ideal of a noble Arab—terrible to
    his enemies, hospitable and munificent to his friends, and especially
    charitable to the poor. I have seen him during the great fast, when
    the Mahomedans may eat nothing till after sunset, call together some
    thirty beggars every evening before his door, bring them food, and
    wait upon them himself with the help of his three grown up sons.
  </p>

  <p>
    The beggars feasted upon kuskussu (porridge made with barley meal)
    and baked mutton with great dignity and grace; and when they were
    satisfied they rose, kissed the Hakim on the shoulders and cheeks,
    and departed. The most contradictory qualities are often united in
    the Arab nature—harshness and benevolence, cruelty and generosity,
    rapacity and munificence: we should beware how we condemn them without
    further knowledge of their character, and we must on no account
    measure them by our Christian and European standard.
  </p>

  <p>
    The great fast of the Mahomedans, which lasts forty days, began a
    few days ago. During all this time the Arabs eat nothing during the
    whole day, and are especially enjoined by the Prophet to be constant
    in devotion and to give freely to the poor:—and the Arab is a very
    strict observer of all his religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> duties. Three times a day, at
    the hours of sunrise, mid-day, and sunset, the loud voice of the
    marabout, or priest, is heard from the minaret of the mosque summoning
    the faithful to prayer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The moment the Arab hears the call of the marabout he throws himself
    upon the earth, wherever he may chance to be, and touches the ground
    with his brow, then rising again he stretches his arms toward heaven
    with his face turned in the direction of Mecca. His white flowing
    bernouse and his long beard give him a venerable and patriarchal air.
    Thus, surely, did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob worship their God. The
    Arab has no hesitation in performing his devotions in the presence
    of the crowd, and is totally without either the false shame or the
    religious hypocrisy of an European.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most Mahomedans wear a rosary of beads, which they tell while
    repeating sentences out of the Koran; to this is usually appended
    a large brass comb, with which they comb their beards during their
    orisons with the most solemn earnestness. The impression produced by
    this on Europeans is highly comical, but to the Mahomedan it seems
    natural enough, as any purification of the body, such as combing and
    washing, are to him in themselves religious acts.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are by no means behind us in superstition, and frequently hang,
    as an amulet round the neck of a favourite horse, a leathern bag
    containing some verses out of the Koran, to protect them from evil
    machinations.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Arab is great and admirable at the hour of death. I have seen many
    Arabs die, but never did I see one beg his life or utter any unmanly
    complaint. When his hour is come he recommends his soul to Mahomed,
    and dies.
  </p>

  <p>
    They have physicians only for external injuries or for fevers
    incidental to the climate: when one of them is attacked by an internal
    disorder or by the decrepitude of age, his relations quietly leave him
    to his fate, and no one troubles his head about him again.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was but a few days ago that I saw an Arab die thus on the threshold
    of his own house: he had already lain there some days with his
    bernouse drawn over his head. When he felt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> approach of death he
    exclaimed with a loud voice, “Mahomed! Mahomed!” and died.
  </p>

  <p>
    The burial is conducted much in the same manner as with us. The
    corpse, rolled in a mantle, and with the face uncovered, is borne to
    the grave by four men. The priest who walks before it sings a song
    to which the others respond in chorus: but their song is cheerful,
    and their step quick; for the departed has quitted the hardships
    and sorrows of this life, and now rests in Paradise beside a shady
    fountain, served by women whose beauty is unfading.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the corpse has been lowered into it, the tomb is carefully
    bricked up, in order to prevent the jackals and hyænas from scratching
    up the body. The mourners then sit round the grave, and one of the
    near relations of the deceased gives to every one present a piece of
    bread and some fruit.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    The fair sex is not altogether fair here, at least in my opinion. No
    one can deny that the Arab women have graceful figures and regular
    features, but they want those essential requisites of beauty—a soul
    and individual expression. They are all exactly alike, and their faces
    express but two passions—love and hate; all nicer shades of feeling
    are wanting. How, indeed, would it be possible for them to acquire
    intellectual or bodily cultivation, when the greater part of their
    time is spent seated cross-legged grinding corn in a hand-mill, or
    asleep?
  </p>

  <p>
    The married women are seldom seen out of their houses, and then only
    closely veiled. The young girls, on the contrary, are to be found
    every morning at sunrise outside the gate of the town, standing by the
    fountain, at which they assemble with stone jars on their shoulders,
    to fetch water for the day’s consumption. This truly Eastern scene
    calls to mind Rebecca at the well, drawing water for her father’s
    flocks.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a stranger asks a daughter of the town to give him a draught of
    water (<i>alma</i>), the maiden reaches him the jar with a kindly nod; but
    when he has slaked his thirst she pours away the remainder and draws
    fresh water, for the lips of the infidel have polluted it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Arab women wear a white woollen garment confined under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> the breast
    by a girdle, and a white cloth twisted round the head. Their ornaments
    generally consist in rings in their ears and on their ankles, which
    are invariably naked. One cannot deny the efficiency of this graceful
    manner of calling attention to the beauty of their feet, which are
    truly exquisite. These rings, among women of the lower class, are of
    silver; among those of the higher class (and here, as in every other
    country, there are distinctions of class), they are of gold.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few days ago my friend Ben Jussuf invited me to go with him to his
    house. I, of course, seized with joy this opportunity of seeing him in
    his domestic circle.
  </p>

  <p>
    He knocked at the door, which is invariably kept shut by day and by
    night in all Arab houses, a woman shortly appeared and inquired who
    was there; at Ben Jussuf’s answer the door was opened, but when the
    woman saw me with her husband she instantly concealed her face, and
    was about to run away; my friend, however, commanded her to remain.
    She was his wife, and besides her he had two others, who were seated
    cross-legged in the court, one of them grinding corn in a hand-mill,
    the other combing the hair of a boy about five or six years old. I
    should have guessed them all three to be at least forty, but Ben
    Jussuf assured me that they were all under five-and-twenty; their
    faces and figures were withered, and the bloom of youth quite gone,
    their eyes alone still retained their fire. At twenty the Arab women
    begin to fade, and at thirty they are old matrons.
  </p>

  <p>
    They all seemed to live in perfect harmony, and the manner of the
    women towards their lord and master was obliging even to servility. To
    judge by appearances, it must be easier to keep house with three wives
    than with one; perhaps the rule “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">divide et impera</i>” holds good in
    love as well as in politics, I must however confess that I do not envy
    the Mahomedan gentlemen their frigid joys, nor do they seem to find
    much satisfaction in them themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    The women here are mere slaves; of that chivalrous homage paid by the
    Spanish Moors to their women no traces are left save in the songs and
    poems of the Arabs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The children are educated by women up to their seventh year; on
    reaching that age the boy is put in possession of a ber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>nouse and
    a pony, and is no longer allowed to eat with the women; should his
    father be away he has supreme authority over the whole household, not
    excepting his own mother.
  </p>

  <p>
    The manner of arranging a marriage is very simple among the Arabs. A
    man takes a sum of money or any article of value, and offers it to
    whomsoever he happens to meet with, saying, “Comrade! I hear you have
    a marriageable daughter, give her to me as a wife, and take this as
    a marriage gift.” If the other thinks the match a suitable one, he
    replies, “Yes: here she is, take her with you;” and the marriage is
    concluded. The father must, however, warrant her to be a maid; and
    if the husband finds she is not, he takes her home next morning and
    demands his present back again.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    Yesterday we made one of the most interesting reconnoitring
    expeditions in which I have been engaged. These expeditions occupy
    several hours, and are undertaken for the purpose of driving the
    Hadjutes out of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rayons</i> of the blockhouses, and the gardens
    belonging to the town. The Hadjutes inhabit the Sahel mountains to
    the westward of Coleah, and are notoriously the most thievish set of
    fellows in all Africa. They are the people who, on the 1st of May, cut
    off the heads of about forty of our regiment at Delhi Ibrahim.
  </p>

  <p>
    We set out before sunrise, and marched down towards the Metidja. I
    was detached on one side with a dozen others, to search the thicket
    with which all this country is covered. We followed a track trodden
    by wild beasts, for a human foot rarely wanders in this place. We
    suddenly emerged into an open space of about thirty square feet, and
    as we stepped out of the thicket a large panther stood before us, at
    about twenty feet distance, and gazed at us with a look of mingled
    wonder and indignation as though he would say, “What seek ye in my
    kingdom?” We, however, appealed to the right of the strongest—two
    or three muskets were instantly levelled and discharged at him, but
    with one bound the panther disappeared among the bushes. A ball or two
    must have reached him, but if they do not happen to hit him on the
    head, which is his only tender point, he takes no heed of them. These
    beasts, and still more hyænas and jackals, abound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> in this district,
    as is shown from the ridiculously small price which is asked by the
    Arabs for the skins of these animals.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Arab chiefs consider the skin of the tiger and the panther as one
    of their principal ornaments. The head of the animal is generally
    fastened to the saddle-bow, (the head and teeth are essential,) and
    the skin waves to and fro with every motion of the horse, so that at a
    distance one might almost imagine that some wild beast had just taken
    a deadly spring upon the rider.
  </p>

  <p>
    But to return to my reconnoitring expedition. On coming near the plain
    we turned westward, to pass the gorge in which Coleah lies. As there
    is no lack of water here, the most abundant vegetation prevails, and
    we were delighted and astonished at the extreme richness of the scene.
    The luxuriant aloe sends up its blossoms to a height of twenty feet,
    and a species of sedgy rush grows as high as a moderate house.
  </p>

  <p>
    From thence we turned towards our dry ditch, which is nearly finished,
    and climbed past it up to the very top of the chain of mountains,
    from whence the sea is visible. Here we found plenty of fruit trees,
    on some of which the fruit was quite ripe; the pomegranates and the
    figs were delicious. In this spot the commander ordered his troops to
    halt. After the necessary precautions had been taken, we were allowed
    to gather the fruit, and were soon scattered about the gardens in all
    directions, filling our <i>shackos</i> and pocket handkerchiefs.
  </p>

  <p>
    After plucking some fine pomegranates, I lay down under a shady
    pomegranate tree, and looked out over the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    I could clearly discern on the blue surface of the sea a ship whose
    prow was directed towards Europe, and whose sails were filled by a
    favourable breeze; the thought involuntarily occurred to me, “Would
    I were on board that ship, sailing towards my own home.” This indeed
    looks a little like home-sickness, but I know not why any one should
    be ashamed of the feeling. Even Odysseus, the wisest of mortals, was
    not ashamed to weep aloud, and to long after his paternal hearth,
    his wife, and his child; and why should not I—who am the least wise
    of men—honestly confess that there are moments when I also long for
    those who are dear to me? Besides, I have seen nearly all there is to
    see in Algeria, the future can but be a repetition of the past.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

  <p>
    I was on the point of beginning a touching monologue—a failing I
    have long been subject to—when I was startled out of my dreams by
    several shots, and a cry of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Aux armes! Aux armes!</i>” We all ran
    to our muskets, and were ready in a moment, but the alarm proved a
    false one. Some twenty Hadjutes, who were lying in ambuscade behind
    a neighbouring hill, had fired several shots at our sentinels, who
    thought a considerable force must be concealed there. But the moment
    we showed ourselves the Hadjutes fled towards the open country, chased
    by a squadron of our horse: the Arabs, however, got clear off, and the
    only damage done was to my monologue, and to the ripe pomegranates
    which I threw away in the hurry and confusion. It was not till about
    nine o’clock, just before the oppressive heat of the day, that we
    returned to Coleah.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chief wealth of the inhabitants of this town consists in large
    herds of cattle and fruit-tree gardens; it is surrounded by the most
    magnificent fruit trees as far as the eye can reach. The figs and
    pomegranates are now ripe, and we feast on them luxuriously. I say
    we, for the most complete community of goods prevails among the Arabs
    and ourselves. The soldier and the beggar are born communists. I must
    say, however, that the Arabs do not seem much to relish this same
    communism, for we have several times missed some of our soldiers; it
    is true we found them again in the gardens, but without their heads.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fruit here is at times extremely dangerous to the head, and when
    eaten immoderately, it is equally injurious to the stomach; this is
    particularly the case with the figs which produce violent thirst,
    and if this is allayed with draughts of water fever and diarrhœa are
    the inevitable consequences. The fig trees bear fruit three times a
    year, but one of the crops is usually of inferior quality: the natives
    generally gather this crop and press it into large cakes; when dry
    these are exceedingly wholesome, and form, throughout the year, a
    favourite dish at the Arab’s table. The pomegranate is a delicious
    fruit, and much less unwholesome. The oranges are so wholesome that
    any one may eat twenty a day with impunity. Unfortunately it is not
    till November that they are ripe.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wild laurel grows in great quantities near the town, and attains a
    very considerable height; I can boast of having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> tasted the fruit of
    the laurel as well as its leaf. It is about the size of a strawberry
    and very sweet. The sight of a laurel tree always recalls to my mind
    that noble Roman folded in his imperial mantle, with the laurel
    wreathed round his bald head. Time was when I would have given the
    last drop of my blood for but one leaf from this same laurel wreath;
    but I have now begun to perceive that when one is no emperor but a
    mere corporal of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voltigeurs</i> the laurel is only good in soup.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    All Arabs of any education or wealth assemble at the coffee-house.
    To them it supplies the place of theatres and concerts, balls and
    tea-parties. There they spend the whole day, sometimes staying till
    past midnight. The coffee-house, like almost all other houses in the
    south, is built round a square court paved with white marble, in the
    middle of which plays a fountain. Round the court are two rows of
    pillars supporting the women’s apartments; the rooms all look into the
    court: on the outside nothing is to be seen but high dismal walls, for
    the Arab does not choose that inquisitive eyes should peer into his
    holy of holies.
  </p>

  <p>
    The vine or ivy is generally trained up the house so as to shade
    the whole court, and keep out the oppressive rays of the sun. Under
    this natural arcade the sons of Ishmael sit on soft carpets lazily
    splashing with their naked feet in the water which flows from the
    fountain over the marble floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here they imbibe coffee, sherbet, songs, and tales: in short, it is
    a foretaste of Paradise. The coffee is not bad, only that they drink
    it black and have the bad taste to reckon the grounds the best part
    of the coffee. Before the slave hands one the cup, he stirs it with a
    reed for fear the dregs should sink to the bottom.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Arab is a passionate lover of music and poetry: the coffee-houses
    are, therefore, never without their poets and story-tellers. Their
    songs are monotonous, and they accompany them with the mandoline, as
    in Andalusia. Coleah possesses the best story-teller and singer in all
    Africa, so celebrated for the melody of his voice as to be called the
    second Hâfiz.
  </p>

  <p>
    I must confess that fame has not said too much in his favour. His
    name is Sofi; at the age of thirteen he had the misfortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> to lose
    a leg in an encounter with the Hadjutes, and since that time he has
    devoted himself entirely to singing and poetry. I never saw an Arab
    whose countenance wore so noble an expression, or whose features
    so clearly reflected the feelings of his soul. He does not usually
    come to the coffee-house till after sunset: as soon as he is seated
    the Arabs place themselves in a half-circle round him, with their
    eyes attentively fixed upon him. After striking a few notes on the
    mandoline, he began one day to recite a ballad of the great deeds and
    of the downfall of the Moorish kings. It was always the same measure,
    the same tune, sung now in a louder, now in a lower tone, and one
    would have expected its monotony to weary the hearers: but not so;
    the longer one listened, the more fascinating it became. First he
    sang the conquest of Spain, the battle of Xeres, and the death of
    Don Rodrigo. He then struck the cords of the mandoline more loudly,
    and sang the victories of Abd-el-Rahman, and the pomp and glory of
    Cordova, till the eyes of his hearers glistened. By slow degrees the
    notes became softer, and his voice trembled as he sang the death of
    the Abencerrages, and the shameful flight of Boabdil, the last king of
    Granada. The sounds of his mandoline died away, the Arabs hung their
    heads upon their breasts, and the pipes fell from their hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    The unfeigned grief of the Moors touched me to the heart. I told my
    friend Ben Jussuf, who sat next to me, that I had visited the scenes
    of their former greatness, the palace of their kings—the Alhambra,
    and the mosque of Cordova, the Kaaba of the west.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scarcely had he told this to the others, when they crowded round me
    begging me to tell all I had seen, and I thus became an involuntary
    story-teller, with Ben Jussuf for my interpreter. I gave them an
    account of the grandeur and beauty of the mosque of Cordova, its
    thirteen hundred columns, and the tombs of their kings. I described
    to them the Alhambra, the marble lions who keep watch at the palace
    gates, the splendid hall where the Abencerrages held their feasts, and
    where they were barbarously murdered. I told them that I myself had
    seen the traces of their noble blood which time itself had been unable
    to efface from the polished marble floor.

    Overcome by the remembrance of the tragical fate of their most heroic
    race, the Arabs covered their faces with their bernouses. “Young man,”
    said the Hakim, kissing my forehead, “thank the Prophet that he hath
    vouchsafed to thee the sight of these marvels.”
  </p>

  <p>
    After a pause the Hakim said, “Friend Sofi, know you not some pleasant
    story which may dissipate the melancholy of our comrades, who still
    sit with drooping heads?” and Sofi, without further entreaty, began
    the following tale.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Far beyond Milianah, on the banks of the Mina, there once lived an
    Emir, on whom Allah had bestowed every blessing. His life was pure
    and blameless. He gave the fourth part of all he possessed to the
    poor, and the hour of prayer was more welcome to him than the hour
    of feasting. This Emir, whose name was Abubekr, had a mare which he
    loved above all other things; she was white, without spot or blemish,
    and more swift than the wind of the desert, and she could travel for
    three days without drinking a single drop of water. One evening before
    sun set, Abubekr stood by the brook cleaning his favourite mare. He
    washed her neck and her haunches, addressing her by the most endearing
    names, and the mare looked in his face with her soft expressive eyes
    as though she understood every word he said. At this moment the
    marabout called the hour of prayer from the minaret, but Abubekr heard
    him not. At last the sun sank down behind mount Atlas, and the Emir
    knew that the hour of prayer was past. In despair he cast himself upon
    the ground and cried, ‘Woe is me, I have forgotten thee, O Lord the
    creator, for the creature; have mercy upon me, and graciously accept
    this sacrifice as a token of my repentance.’ Having said this, he took
    his spear and plunged it into the breast of his mare, and she fell to
    the earth and died. Sorrowful, but conscious of having done aright,
    Abubekr returned to his dwelling, folded his bernouse about him, and
    slept. And Allah appeared to him in a dream and spake to him thus,
    ‘Abubekr, I have proved thy heart, and have seen that thou walkest
    before me justly. I desire not the sacrifices of the just, but their
    good deeds, for I am gracious. Arise, thy mare liveth.’ The Emir
    started up rejoicing and hastened to the door—there stood his darling
    mare, and neighed joyfully at the sight of him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> Abubekr prostrated
    himself and touched the dust with his forehead, exclaiming, ‘Allah,
    thy wisdom is infinite, but thy mercy is yet greater than thy wisdom!’”

    Farewell. Next week our regiment will march to Algiers, whence it will

  <p class="rightinset">Mustapha Superieur, August, 1840.</p>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">We</span> came in sight of the coast of Africa on the 8th of August at nine
    in the morning. This was the second time I had seen it; the first was
    in the straits of Gibraltar. But I now beheld it with far different
    feelings. I was about to tread the land of the Bedouin and of the
    Kabyle in the full enjoyment of my strength and liberty—perhaps never
    to return.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first step in life is a man’s own choice, the second is no longer
    within his control but subject to foreign and often hostile influences.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may well shake your head, dear friend, reproach me as usual with
    Quixotism, and wonder how it is that the experience gained in Spain
    has not cooled my ardour. I allow it is cooled, but not chilled. I
    have still ardour enough left to venture—a true Don Quixote of the
    nineteenth century—a crusade for civilisation and freedom. Forward,
    then, and let me pass the Rubicon, without hesitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The steamboat strove onwards with might and main, the coast rose
    higher out of the sea every moment, and before very long the glorious
    bay in which lies Algiers, and the Sahel range of mountains lay clear
    before us. The town itself is built in the shape of an amphitheatre
    on the declivity of the Sahel hills, and when seen from a distance
    looks like a huge white pyramid, for the town forms a triangle the
    highest point of which is crowned by the Casabah—the former residence
    of the Dey. The bay presents an enchanting scene for a few miles
    eastward of Algiers. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> sides of the mountains are crowded with
    beautiful gardens and villas built in the noble Moorish style. On the
    very ridge of the Sahel is a semicircular chain of fortified camps
    and blockhouses intended to protect this fruitful district against
    the inroads of the Berbers. The harbour is so small that only a few
    ships can ride there, and the greater part are compelled to lie at
    anchor outside in the roads. We had scarce dropped one anchor when a
    number of small boats surrounded the ship to convey us ashore. The
    rowers were galley slaves who, in a melancholy air, kept time to the
    stroke of their oars. The subject of the song was as follows:—“An
    aged galley slave, with the faded ribbon of the legion of honour on
    his breast, stands on the pier and looks gloomily down upon the sea
    as though he would fathom its depths with his chains. A Marshal of
    France passes by and sees the ribbon on his breast. ‘Where,’ he asks,
    ‘did you deserve it?’ The slave answers gloomily, ‘I won it in such a
    battle;’ and the Marshal recognises the man who once saved his life.
    Filled with gratitude, he entreats the pardon of the king for the
    unhappy prisoner, and it is granted.” This song made an indelible
    impression on my mind, and convinced me that even the galleys have a
    poetry of their own.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lower part of the town which surrounds the port has already
    acquired a completely European character. The streets of Babazoun
    and of the Marine are as handsome and as elegant as the Boulevards
    of Paris. The upper town retains its Arab colour, and is exclusively
    inhabited by Moors and Jews. The streets are so narrow that it is
    with difficulty that two horses can pass in them; and the Arabs have
    no kind of carriages. I was beyond measure surprised at the motley
    crowd with which I suddenly found myself surrounded, and fancied that
    I must be in a masquerade; Arabs and Frenchmen, Jews and Italians,
    Spaniards and Negroes were mixed in picturesque confusion. Next door
    to an elegant French milliner, an Arab barber was shaving the heads
    of his fellow-countrymen, and an Italian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">restaurant</i>, who extolled
    his maccaroni to every passer-by, was the neighbour of a Moorish
    slipper-maker. Everything wore a martial aspect, troops were landing,
    and horse-soldiers galloping about the streets; in short, I soon
    perceived that the gay scene around me was no carnival merry-making.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

  <p>
    In order to get rid of the uncomfortable feelings left by a sea
    voyage I wished to take a bath, and asked the first man I met where
    one was to be found. A good-natured, talkative Frenchman pointed out
    a Moorish bath to me in the very next street and on my way thither
    told me his whole life and adventures, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en passant</i>, which I have
    been so fortunate as to forget. The bath was excellent, and cost
    only one franc from first to last. After bathing me for some time in
    lukewarm water, a couple of sturdy Arabs scrubbed me with brushes
    and kneaded me with their fists in such a manner that I expected the
    fellows would break every bone in my body. They next rubbed me with
    perfumed oil, wrapped me in a bernouse, and gave me a cup of black
    coffee and a pipe; the latter was lost upon me, as I do not smoke.
    I departed feeling like one newly born, and resumed my ramble about
    the streets. After wandering about for some time without any settled
    purpose, I began to feel a certain longing after I knew not what, an
    inward yearning which I would fain have satisfied; at last, just as
    I was passing the shop of an Italian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">restaurant</i> which sent forth a
    most seductive odour of fried fish, the happy thought struck me that I
    perhaps was hungry. I accordingly went in and ordered a dish of fish,
    which made their appearance very well fried in oil, and a bottle of
    Spanish wine. My sensations were soon so agreeable that I forgot all
    my good and evil fortunes, nay, almost even the reason of my presence
    here. As the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">restaurant</i>, a Neapolitan, also let lodgings, I hired a
    room there for a few days, to reconnoitre the ground a little before
    taking any further steps.
  </p>

  <p>
    After having satisfied my curiosity for the present with looking at
    this strange scene, I went out at the gate Babazoun (Eastern gate)
    towards Mustapha Superieur, which was formerly the palace of the
    Dey’s son, but now serves for a depôt of the Foreign Legion. It is
    built on a declivity of the Sahel, about a league from Algiers, and
    is surrounded by most exquisite fruit gardens. Traces of the former
    splendor of this palace still remained, notwithstanding the ravages of
    the soldiery. It is built round two large courts, the smaller of which
    is adorned with sixty-four marble columns supporting most splendid
    rooms, which were formerly inhabited by the Prince’s seraglio, but
    are now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> turned into workshops for a whole company of shoemakers and
    tailors.
  </p>

  <p>
    As soon as possible I presented myself before General Von Hulsen, who
    commanded the Foreign Legion, and related my former life to him. After
    quietly listening to my story and my determination to enter the Legion
    as a volunteer, he plainly told me that I was about to commit a great
    piece of folly and to sacrifice my health and life to no purpose.
    His words have proved but too true; but, unfortunately, I am not
    one of those who can profit by the experience of others: I must see
    everything with my own eyes and touch everything with my own hands.
    The General, seeing that I was determined to stay, promised to protect
    me as far as lay in his power.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately he was killed three months after, while we were throwing
    provisions into Fonduk: far too soon for me and for the Legion. He
    belonged to the Pomeranian family Von Hulsen, and had served in the
    French army under Napoleon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hulsen’s was a true German character, bold and straightforward even
    to roughness; he was the only one who had the courage to protect the
    interests of the Foreign Legion against the French general officers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was asked whether I knew how to load and fire, and on my replying
    in the affirmative, I was, without further question, transferred
    to the third battalion of the Legion, at that moment quartered at
    Dschigeli, for which spot a transport was to sail in a few days.
    Until then I was my own master, and employed these few, and possibly
    last hours of liberty in strolling about the town and the surrounding
    country to satisfy my curiosity. Although these were the hottest and
    most unhealthy months of the year, I did not find the heat nearly so
    oppressive as I had expected. The whole northern declivity of the
    Sahel mountains enjoys a temperate and agreeable climate, owing to its
    proximity to the sea. We hear of scarcely any illness here.
  </p>

  <p>
    The whole coast, from Algiers as far as the fortified camp of Kouba,
    was formerly inhabited by the most wealthy Turks and Moors, who spent
    here in Oriental ease and voluptuous idleness the riches they obtained
    by piracy. Their country houses, built in a noble style of Moorish
    architecture, are proofs of the wealth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> of their former possessors.
    These are still in good repair, and are inhabited by Frenchmen and
    Spaniards who have bought them for a trifle for the sake of the
    gardens of fruit and vegetables. The soil is wonderfully productive
    owing to the numerous springs which rise in the mountains and water
    the ground throughout the year. Traces are still found both of the
    Roman and the Moorish method of irrigation. The bold arches of the
    Romans have long since fallen to decay, while the modest and simple
    earthen pipes of the Moors, which creep below the surface of the
    earth, still convey a fresh and plentiful supply of water. These few
    square miles on the Sahel form nearly the whole of the boasted French
    colony in Africa; <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafés</i> and canteens are their only possessions
    beyond the fortified camps and the range of the blockhouses, even near
    the largest towns, such as Medeah, Milianah, Mascara, &amp;c., and these
    are only supported by the military, and may therefore be said to draw
    their resources from France.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the first years of the French occupation a considerable tract
    of the plains of Metidja came under cultivation. But the bad policy
    and worse system of defence of the French soon ruined the colonists.
    One morning, in the year 1839, Abd-el-Kader and his hordes poured down
    from the lesser Atlas range and destroyed everything with fire and
    sword. Those who escaped death were dragged into captivity. Since then
    the colonists have lost all confidence in the Government, and it will
    be very long before they recover it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Agriculture requires perfect security of property and, above all,
    personal security. Setting aside the precarious condition of the
    colonists, the French are thoroughly bad settlers, and only know how
    to set up <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafés</i>. The few good agriculturists to be found here are
    either Germans or Spaniards. It is remarkable that the Spaniards, who
    in their own country are so lazy that they had rather starve than
    work, are here the very best agricultural labourers. Their diligence
    and economy almost amount to avarice.
  </p>

  <p>
    My favourite walk is to the Plane Tree <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">café</i>, so called from a group
    of beautiful plane trees which overshadow it. A plentiful spring of
    water gushes out of a rock close by, and tumbles down the hill on its
    way to the sea; so that nothing is wanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> to the enjoyment of an
    inhabitant of the south. The house stands under Mustapha Superieur
    and affords a magnificent view over the sea and the bay of Algiers.
    On this spot some dozen Turks and Arabs dream away the greater part
    of their lives. The owner of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">café</i> is an old Turk who formerly
    served among the mamelukes of the Dey. He passed some years of his
    life a prisoner in Spain, where, besides corrupt and broken Spanish,
    he learned to drink and swear. It was comical enough to hear this
    “malignant and turbaned Turk” introduce a <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">caramba</i> between every
    other word. He told me some very remarkable facts relating to the
    Dey’s government. It seems that the tribes could only be kept in any
    obedience by means of a strong body of cavalry continually scouring
    the country. Whenever a tribe delayed the payment of its tribute
    the mamelukes came down upon them in the dead of the night, cut
    down all the men and carried off the women and cattle. He was by no
    means satisfied with the French mode of warfare and maintained that
    they ought to have more cavalry, and that the infantry, for which he
    entertained a profound contempt, were far too slow in their movements.
    “The first thing in war,” said he, with a volley of Spanish oaths, “is
    quickness: the French always arrive too late.” You see that my friend
    the Turk is a very distinguished strategist; and I almost think it
    must have been from him that Bugeaud afterwards took the hint of the
    <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">razzia</i> and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">colonne mobile</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The old greybeard is a devoted admirer of Spanish women and Spanish
    wine; when talking of either his eyes sparkled. He generally kept a
    keg of Malaga hidden in his house and took a good pull at it from time
    to time. When in a good humour he gave me a wink and we drank to the
    health of the Spanish women. He thoroughly despised his Arab guests,
    whom he called “brutos” (beasts), who were fit for nothing but to
    count their beads and smoke their pipes.
  </p>

  <p>
    You perceive that my friend Hassan is a freethinker, who has shaken
    off all the restraints of the Koran. Had the Arabs suspected this
    but for a moment, they would have spat in his face, and never set
    foot over his threshold again; for they are strict observers of their
    religious duties.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

  <p>
    As we are under orders to start at a moment’s notice for Dschigeli, I
    took leave of the Turk yesterday. He gave me his blessing and a glass
    of Malaga, recommending me, above all things not to trust those dogs
    of Arabs, and to beware of eating figs and drinking water.
  </p>

  <p>To-morrow we embark on board a steamer bound for Bona.</p>

  <p class="rightinset">Dschigeli, August, 25.</p>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">We</span> reached Dschigeli on the 15th, after a most prosperous voyage of
    thirty-six hours, which included a short stay at Budschia.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the summer the surface of the Mediterranean is almost always
    as smooth as a mirror. The blue transparent water looks so gentle and
    harmless that one can scarce believe in the terrific powers which
    slumber in its bosom. In the later autumn it entirely alters its
    character; storms, and frequently even hurricanes, render the African
    coasts the most dangerous in the world; the more so, since the whole
    territory occupied by the French does not contain a single safe and
    capacious harbour of refuge. Last year, the French lost in the roads
    before Stora, a short distance from hence, no less than forty vessels
    in one night.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Government has endeavoured to remedy this evil by constructing
    artificial harbours, and has, at an enormous cost, somewhat enlarged
    that of Algiers by sinking blocks of stone and a species of cement
    into the sea; but of course little can be effected in this manner.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dschigeli, which also has only a small roadstead, is built on a rock
    rising out of the sea; it belongs to the province of Constantina and
    lies between Budschia and Philippeville. It is inhabited by Turks and
    Arabs, who formerly drove a thriving trade in piracy. Although the
    town looks like a mere heap of stones, it is said still to contain
    much hidden treasure. The soldiers are already hoping for an outbreak
    among the population<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> which may afford them an excuse for pillaging
    the town. This does not, however, seem very likely, as the Arabs are
    on very good terms with the garrison, and not without reason, for the
    Kabyles who dwell in the neighbouring mountains would not treat them
    so well as the French do.
  </p>

  <p>
    The whole district between Algiers and Dschigeli, along which runs the
    high range of the Aphronne mountains, is the proper country of the
    Kabyles.
  </p>

  <p>
    The French possess no more of it than what they have enclosed within a
    line of blockhouses, that is, about half a square mile. Our battalion,
    the third of the Foreign Legion, forms the whole garrison: it is
    commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Picolou, a Frenchman. Like the rest
    of the Legion, this battalion is composed of men of all nations and
    all ranks: Spaniards and Italians, Germans and Belgians, Dutchmen
    and Poles, only no English. Most of them have joined the service out
    of mere folly, some from political or civil offences, and a few from
    misfortune.
  </p>

  <p>
    These men are for the most part brutal and undisciplined, but ready to
    encounter anything. They form a band who, under an energetic leader,
    might do great things. Like all hirelings, our corps has much of the
    character of Wallenstein’s camp. At first I thought that my fate was a
    very tragical one, but even this comfort was soon taken from me. There
    is not one among us who has not the history and adventures of his life
    to tell, and the worst of all is that one is forced to confess that
    there is nothing tragical which has not its comic side. I may safely
    assert that I have heard more biographies in one day here than are to
    be found in all Plutarch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nearly all the commissions in the Legion are held by Frenchmen who
    look upon this as a short cut to advancement. Among the officers are
    also a few Poles and Swiss; the latter of whom have joined the service
    since the revolution of July. But, in general, it is very difficult
    for a foreigner to attain to the rank of an officer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although Dschigeli lies under nearly the same latitude as Algiers, it
    is far hotter and more unhealthy. Nearly half the garrison is rendered
    unfit for service by fever, which makes the duty of those who are well
    doubly severe. The oppressive heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> has a very remarkable effect upon
    all new comers, whose strength leaves them from day to day; and men,
    as strong as lions before, creep about with pale yellow faces and with
    voices as small as those of children. Every morning before daybreak
    seven or eight corpses are secretly carried out of the town. Hitherto
    I have resisted the influence of the climate, but I take more care
    of myself than the rest, and do not indulge in eating fruit, &amp;c. The
    first rule of health is to follow as nearly as possible the manner of
    life of the natives of foreign countries, for one may fairly presume
    that they have good reasons for adhering to particular customs from
    generation to generation. Most inhabitants of the north of Europe ruin
    their health by persisting in the same habits abroad which they follow
    in their own country.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">September, 1840.</p>

  <p>
    We spend alternately fourteen days in the town, and fourteen in
    the blockhouses: the latter is by far the most interesting. The
    blockhouses, placed in a semicircle on the heights surrounding the
    town, are built of oak planks imported from France and of sufficient
    thickness to turn a bullet. They are generally two stories high, and
    are protected by a wall and a ditch. The largest are provided with two
    cannons and some wall-pieces, which are of great service.
  </p>

  <p>
    To prevent time from hanging heavy on our hands, our friends the
    Kabyles come down from the neighbouring mountains to pay their
    respects to us. They greet us from afar with a torrent of friendly
    epithets, such as “hahluf” (swine), &amp;c., which is quickly followed by
    a shower of balls. We are no less civil in our turn, allowing them to
    approach within a short distance, when we treat them to a volley of
    musketry and a few discharges from the field-pieces; whereupon they
    usually retire somewhat tranquillized but still vehement in abuse. We
    of course have much the best of it behind our walls and ditches, but
    from time to time some of us are wounded or killed.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few days ago they attacked us with unusual fury and pertinacity.
    Some time before sunrise we saw a large party of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> Kabyles coming
    down from the mountains: as far as the eye could reach the place
    swarmed with white bernouses. Every blockhouse was attacked at the
    same moment. Our well-directed fire was insufficient to keep off an
    enemy which pressed upon us in dense masses, and in a moment they were
    close under the walls. Here they could no longer do us any damage
    with their shots; but in their rage they threw huge stones over the
    walls upon our heads. We made a rapid retreat into our blockhouses and
    barricadoed the doors. In one moment the Kabyles climbed the outer
    walls, and attempted in their blind fury to storm the blockhouses.
    Some of them tried, but in vain, to throw the cannon over the walls;
    and they now had the worst of the fight.
  </p>

  <p>
    The half of our party who were in the upper story removed a plank
    which was left loose for the purpose, and poured their fire down upon
    the heads of the Kabyles, while some cannoneers who were with us threw
    a number of hand-grenades, of which we had good store, among them.
    This was rather more than they could bear, and they dispersed in all
    directions, yelling fearfully; they however carried off their dead and
    wounded, for the Mohamedan never leaves his comrades in the hands of
    the foe.
  </p>

  <p>They did not repeat their visit for several days after this.</p>

  <p>
    The Kabyles, who are a strong and courageous race, inhabit fixed
    dwellings, and employ themselves in agriculture as well as in
    cattle-breeding. They always fight on foot, armed with a yataghan and
    a long rifle which will carry almost as far as our wall-pieces.

    They hardly ever attack by night, for one of the precepts of the
    Koran is—neither to wander nor to wage war by night, and this they
    pretty scrupulously obey; and indeed they are altogether far better
    Mohamedans than we are Christians.
  </p>

  <p>
    I need not add that on these occasions every one does his duty, for
    each fights for that which he most values, namely his head. He who
    falls into the hands of the Kabyles is born under no lucky planet—his
    head is instantly cut off and borne away as a trophy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Commandant marched up into the mountains one night with the whole
    garrison, to chastise the Kabyles for their insolence. We started
    at midnight under the guidance of some Arabs who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> knew the country
    and marched, without stopping and in deep silence, up hill and down
    dale until just before daybreak, when the crowing of cocks and the
    baying of dogs gave us notice that we were close upon a tribe. We were
    ordered to halt, and two companies with a few field-pieces were left
    behind on an eminence.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a short rest we started again, and the first glimmer of light
    showed the huts of the tribe straight before us. An old Kabyle was at
    that moment going out with a pair of oxen to plough; as soon as he
    saw us he uttered a fearful howl and fled, but a few well-directed
    shots brought him down. In one moment the grenadiers and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voltigeurs</i>,
    who were in advance, broke through the hedge of prickly pear which
    generally surrounds a Kabyle village, and the massacre began. Strict
    orders had been given to kill all the men and only to take the women
    and children prisoners: for we followed the precept of “an eye for an
    eye, a tooth for a tooth.”
  </p>

  <p>
    A few men only reeled half awake out of their huts, but most of them
    still lay fast asleep; not one escaped death. The women and children
    rushed, howling and screaming, out of their burning huts in time
    to see their husbands and brothers butchered. One young woman with
    an infant at her breast started back at the sight of strange men
    exclaiming “Mohamed! Mohamed!” and ran into her burning hut. Some
    soldiers sprang forward to save her, but the roof had already fallen
    in and she and her child perished in the flames.
  </p>

  <p>
    We then returned with our booty, and it was high time, for other
    tribes of Kabyles came flocking together from every side, attracted by
    the noise. We were forced to retreat in such haste that we left the
    greater part of the cattle behind. The fire of the companies we had
    stationed in our rear with the field-pieces at last gained us time to
    breathe. We however had but few killed and wounded.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few days after, a deputation was sent by the survivors with
    proposals for the exchange of the women and children against cattle,
    which was accepted. It is a point of honour with the Kabyles not
    to leave their women and children in the enemies’ hands. They most
    conscientiously ransomed even the old women whom we would willingly
    have given them gratis.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>
    For several days we have been suffering severely from the wind of
    the desert (samoom) which prevails here during the months of August
    and September. This wind is scorching and impregnated with minute
    particles of sand. At its approach all are filled with terror, large
    drops of sweat stand on one’s brow, and the only means of escape is to
    lie flat on one’s face and to hold one’s breath. Those who inhale the
    air die in twenty minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately the samoom only lasts from a quarter of an hour to twenty
    minutes, but it returns several times a day. During its prevalence
    all hostilities cease; for the natives and the very wild beasts are
    subject to its influence. When surprised by this wind during a march,
    all instantly halt. Camels, horses, and mules, instinctively turn
    their backs to the wind and hold their noses close to the ground until
    the danger is past.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    The day before yesterday we had a hot encounter with the Kabyles,
    after a fashion truly Homeric, in defence of our oxen. Our company was
    ordered to escort the cattle, which are numerous, to the water.
  </p>

  <p>
    The incessant heat had already dried up all the fountains and springs
    within the line of the blockhouses, so that we were forced to drive
    the cattle beyond it to a stream which flows from the mountains
    and never fails. We advanced as usual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en tiralleurs</i> to cover the
    watering-place, but we had scarcely reached the further side of the
    stream when we were greeted on all sides by yells and bullets. The
    Kabyles had hidden themselves in the brushwood close by, and occupied
    an eminence opposite to us. In order to make use of our strongest
    weapon, the bayonet, which is much dreaded by the Kabyles, we advanced
    up the hill with levelled bayonets and took it at the first attack.
    But scarce had we reached the top when we received a heavy fire from
    all sides, the Kabyles having surrounded us in a semicircle. In a
    moment we had several killed and wounded and were forced to retreat
    faster than we had advanced, the Kabyles pressing furiously on our
    rear. The commanding officer exclaimed: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sauvez les blessés! Sauvez les blessés!</i>”
  </p>

  <p>
    A non-commissioned officer close beside me had been shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> through
    the jaw; he had completely lost his senses, and was reeling round
    and round like a drunken man. I seized him under the arm and
    dragged him towards the nearest blockhouse into which the company
    retreated. We were the very last, and the Kabyles yelled wildly close
    behind us while their bullets whistled in our ears; I was not hit
    however, and succeeded in bringing my charge safely home, conscious
    of having done my duty as a soldier and as a man. We had but just
    reached the blockhouse when the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Commandant Superieur</i> came up with
    a reinforcement of several companies, and sent us all out again
    to rescue the cattle, which by this time had all but fallen into
    the enemy’s hands. The beasts were so deeply engaged in the noble
    occupation of drinking that it was almost impossible to move them from
    the spot.
  </p>

  <p>
    We now repulsed the Kabyles, and at length the horsemen succeeded
    in driving off the cattle. After this we came to a sort of tacit
    understanding with the enemy to leave each other in peace at the
    stream, for they too had to water their cattle there and might have
    been seriously incommoded by us from the blockhouse.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was my first battle in the open field, and I cannot say that it
    made much impression upon me. My imagination had pictured the terrors
    of the scene so vividly to me that the reality fell far short of it.
    I was moreover prepared for it by all manner of perils which I had
    encountered by land and by sea. I have frequently observed that men
    of lively imagination (and accordingly most southerns) have a greater
    dread of fancied than of real dangers. Before the decisive moment
    arrives they have exhausted all the terrors of death and are prepared
    for the worst. The cold phlegmatic northern, on the contrary, goes
    with greater coolness into battle, but often finds it worse than he
    expected.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    I have suffered a severe loss; the only friend I had found here died
    a few days ago. Similar tastes and a like fate had drawn us together.
    He was of a good family at Berlin, as the high cultivation of his mind
    sufficiently proved; but an unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> longing for excitement and
    adventure had driven him from home. I am convinced that he died of
    home-sickness. He had never served before, and could not, therefore,
    brook this brutal and savage life so well as I could, and a fever
    hastened his death. He had written to his father for money to obtain
    his discharge, under the conviction that he could not endure his life
    here, and was in the daily expectation of an answer. His imagination
    already transported him back to his family; but he grew weaker every
    day and at length had to be carried to the hospital, where I visited
    him daily when my turn of service did not prevent me. When I went
    yesterday and inquired after him, one of the attendants pointed to his
    bed: on approaching it I found him dead. No one, not even his next
    neighbour, had heard him die. He was buried next morning with no kind
    of ceremony, and I followed him to the grave alone. It is well for him
    that he is at peace! His spirit was too gentle to bear the sight of
    all this cruelty and wretchedness. One must case one’s heart in triple
    brass to bear existence here at all.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    Since the 1st of December our company has been quartered in Fort
    Duquesne, which stands upon the sea and defends the south-eastern side
    of the town. This fort is built upon a rock rising so abruptly from
    the sea that a few half-bastions towards the land are sufficient for
    its defence. A wooden shed has been erected to shelter the garrison
    from the weather.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are uncommonly well off here, for the duty is not severe: most of
    our time is spent in fishing. The coasts of Africa abound with various
    sorts of fish which, to us at least, appear excellent; but indeed many
    circumstances combine to make us think so. A small kind of oyster,
    which is also met with in Spain, and sea-hedgehogs are particularly
    abundant. We only have to take them off the rocks, to open and eat
    them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The starfish too are common here, and I have a strange tale to tell
    of one. During the month of August the soldiers were in the habit of
    bathing in the sea every evening, and from time to time several of
    them disappeared, no one knew how. Bathing was in consequence strictly
    forbidden, in spite of which several men went into the water one
    evening; suddenly one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> them screamed for help, and when several
    others rushed to his assistance they found that a huge starfish had
    seized him by the leg with four of its limbs, whilst it clung to the
    rock by the fifth. The soldiers brought the monster home with them,
    and out of revenge they broiled it alive and ate it. This adventure
    sufficiently accounted for the disappearance of the other soldiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rainy season, which generally lasts three or four months, has
    already set in accompanied by hurricanes of extraordinary violence,
    which fortunately last but a short time, though indeed quite long
    enough to cause the death and ruin of countless sailors. A few days
    ago a vessel was dashed to pieces against the very rock upon which the
    fort stands. It turned out to be a French merchant brig, which had
    anchored in the roads to avoid the raging of the elements. Another
    night, while I was on watch, the storm increased by degrees to a
    perfect hurricane; the rain came down in torrents, and the darkness
    was such that it was impossible to see a yard before one’s face. In
    a moment the wooden shed was unroofed, and the waves dashed over the
    very top of the rock. Next morning the fragments of a vessel lay at
    our feet; the roaring of the wind and waves had entirely overpowered
    the crash of the shipwreck. Every soul on board had perished except
    a little dog which stood wet and trembling on a jutting cliff and
    was with difficulty induced to come to us: he appeared to be still
    expecting his master.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Mediterranean has scarce any tide, but the north or south wind
    affects the ebb or flow on the African coast though only to the depth
    of a few feet. After a few days of calm its blue waters are so clear
    that the fish and seaweed, some hundred feet below, look as though one
    might touch them. There is a peculiar charm in thus looking down into
    the secrets of Neptune’s kingdom. I often lie for hours on a jutting
    cliff, watching the crowd of fish sporting below, and the tortoises,
    those drones of the sea, lazily basking on the surface of the waves.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mind involuntarily reverted to my childhood, and to my mother’s
    story of the enchanted prince whom a beautiful mermaid imprisoned in
    her crystal palace deep under the sea. After a hundred years, which
    passed like a few months, the charm was broken and the prince returned
    upon the earth to ascend the throne of his forefathers. But, alas!
    all was changed—his race<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> was extinct and there was none that knew
    him; he himself had long since forgotten the language of men. Then he
    longed to return to his crystal prison and cast himself headlong into
    the waves.
  </p>

  <p>
    At times I can scarce refrain from following the example of the
    enchanted prince and going to lead a harmless peaceful life with the
    fish, far from the rapacious envious race of men. But even this were
    vain, for under the water too there is strife, and greediness, and
    ambition—every thing, in short, save calumny.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">February, 1841.</p>

  <p>
    For nearly two months we have not once been disturbed by the Kabyles,
    and we should have enjoyed a state of the most tranquil peace and
    content had it not been for the fleas. These bloodthirsty monsters
    are indeed the most terrible enemies we have in Africa—nothing can
    protect us from their hostilities. I assure you that Kabyles and
    panthers, nay, even tight boots, or a bad conscience, are not to
    be compared to them. They are worst in the wooden barracks and the
    blockhouses. One must be worn out with fatigue in order to sleep there
    at all, and then one wakes covered from head to foot with specks of
    blood.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the night of the 4th of February, contrary to their usual custom,
    the Kabyles paid us a very well-meant visit. We lay in our barracks,
    not dreaming of any danger, when we were awakened at eleven o’clock
    at night by repeated shots, and by some bullets which came through
    the deal boards of our barracks. In an instant we were dressed; each
    man snatched up his musket, and went out. The shots came from a rock
    to the westward of the town and only separated from it by a small arm
    of the sea. By some strange neglect no blockhouse had been built on
    this spot, which commanded the town. The Kabyles had stolen through
    the line of blockhouses in the dark, and from this rock they now fired
    into the town with their long rifles with some effect. The companies
    soon fell into rank. Lieutenant-Colonel Picolou, a cool determined
    officer, made his appearance immediately, and placed all the sentinels
    of the town on a battery exactly opposite the rock, to answer the
    fire of the Kabyles and thus to make them believe that the whole
    garrison was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> there: in the meantime we marched out at the gate in
    perfect silence, reached the rock unobserved, and fell suddenly upon
    their rear. At the very moment when they saw us and raised their wild
    howl, we gave them a volley and charged them with the bayonet. As the
    Kabyles are totally unacquainted with the use of it, they could offer
    us no effectual resistance although they were double our number. Those
    who were not killed threw themselves into the sea, for, being mostly
    good swimmers, they chose rather to trust to the tender mercies of
    the waves than to ours. But even the very elements conspired against
    them. The sea was very rough, and the waves dashed the poor fellows to
    pieces against the rocks. But few escaped to tell the mournful tale to
    their kinsfolk. We remained on the rock till the following morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had only taken three prisoners, for in the heat of the skirmish the
    soldiers cut down every one. Some, indeed, had even cut off the heads
    of the wounded with their own yataghans. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Commandant Superieur</i>
    rewarded these heroes with five franc pieces, and stuck the heads
    over the city gates, where they remained until the stench became
    intolerable. Truly I almost begin to think that we have learned more
    of the barbarous manners of the Kabyles, than they of our humanity and
    civilisation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In two days, a few old men belonging to the almost annihilated tribe
    came to implore peace and the permission to remove and bury their
    dead, which latter request was granted. They also wished to ransom
    the three prisoners, one of whom was the son of their chief, and
    offered forty oxen for them, but the Commandant demanded eighty and
    the negotiators were forced to depart without them. Greatly to the
    annoyance of the Commandant and the astonishment of us all, one fine
    day the prisoners had disappeared. They had been confined in a dry
    cistern close to the sea and had, with inconceivable difficulty,
    worked their way through to it in one night, let themselves down
    into the water by means of their long woollen girdles, and swum to
    the other side. This was no slight matter, as the coast is tolerably
    distant and one of the prisoners had his thigh shattered by a bullet.
    They then escaped safely through all the outposts. For eight whole
    days the Kabyles kept coming to fetch the dead bodies of their
    relations. Their joyful songs contrasted sadly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> with their melancholy
    faces. They were entirely crushed by this last blow, which they looked
    upon as a chastisement from Allah, because they had transgressed his
    command to wage no war by night. Most of the corpses had to be fished
    up out of the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    I watched them one morning at this employment. The Kabyles stood round
    a body they had just found, and drew the mantle from off the head.
    Scarce had an old Kabyle seen the features of the corpse, than he
    turned away his face to hide his tears; perhaps it was his son. And
    the soldiers who stood by jeered him!
  </p>

  <p>
    Truly war is wild work; especially a war to the knife, such as this.
    It is lucky for us that custom renders us indifferent to our own
    dangers and miseries, but then we often grow equally indifferent to
    the woes of others.

    We have just heard that we are to have a new Governor; no other than

    a vigorous, enterprising man, and great things are expected from him.
  </p>

  <p>
    An expedition into the interior against the Bedouins is talked of,
    in which we are to take part; and we have already received orders to

    <span class="smcap">We</span> reached the bay of Algiers in the evening of the 29th of March.
    The voyage was favourable, but I cannot say that it was pleasant; six
    hundred of us were squeezed together on the deck of a steamer. I am
    perfectly convinced that a pickled herring has more space allotted to
    it in the barrel than a soldier on board a French steamboat. In the
    Mediterranean, troops are always conveyed on deck, in the steamers at
    least.
  </p>

  <p>
    The air here is mild enough for this, even in winter; but during the
    often-continued rains, one sometimes cannot help sighing for one’s own
    fireside.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coast is uninteresting all the way from Dschigeli to Algiers.
    There is nothing to be seen but hills—some covered with brushwood,
    and others quite bare. There are but few valleys or streams, and
    scarce any human dwellings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Near Budschia you discover from the sea a beautiful and fruitful vale
    watered by the river Summam. This is occupied by some of the most
    powerful Kabyle tribes, which give a good deal of trouble to the
    French garrison at Budschia. The town stands on an eminence commanding
    the mouth of the river and great part of the valley, and is enclosed
    by a line of blockhouses. Budschia is one of the oldest towns in
    Africa, as is proved by a Roman fort in tolerable preservation, and
    the remains of walls. There is a small bay here which affords good
    anchorage for vessels and protection against the south and west winds.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

  <p>
    A species of monkey, as large as a pointer, abounds in these
    mountains. While we lay at anchor in the roadstead for a few hours, we
    had ample opportunity of observing the conduct of several families of
    these apes on a neighbouring rock. Curiosity drew many of them very
    near to us, and we were vastly amused by their strange antics; but as
    soon as any on board made the motion of shooting they skipped away,
    evidently well aware of its meaning. In one moment the fond mothers
    flung their sons across their backs, and disappeared behind the rocks.
    It is very difficult to get at these monkeys, as they live in caves
    which no human foot can reach, and their whole system of defence is
    excellent; their service of sentinels is as regularly organised as
    that of the Kabyles.
  </p>

  <p>
    At about five leagues from Algiers the Atlas mountains gradually
    recede and give place to the great plain of Metidja, which is watered
    by the Arrasch and the Messafren. This plain is divided from the
    mountain in a peculiarly abrupt manner; it has not the undulating
    surface of other valleys, but is as flat as a table from the foot of
    the Atlas to the base of the Sahel range. The Metidja, varying from
    three to five leagues in breadth, forms a semicircle of about fifteen
    leagues, and touches the sea twice, at <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Maison Carrée</i>, and just below
    Cherchell. It would be one of the most fruitful districts in the world
    if it had but more water; but the rivers get low even in the month
    of June, and the earth is so parched by the rays of the sun that all
    vegetation withers, and only begins to revive in October with the
    autumn rains. Close to the foot of the mountain and near the river,
    where the soil is kept moist by artificial means, the earth yields two
    crops of corn and three of vegetables in the year.
  </p>

  <p>
    We landed immediately and marched the same evening to Buterback,
    whence I now have the honour of writing to you. Buterback was formerly
    the castle of a Moorish grandee; it stands on the topmost ridge of the
    Sahel, not far from the camp of Kouba. We have a glorious view of the
    sea on one side, and of the Metidja and the lesser Atlas on the other.
    Nearly every evening we see, on the Atlas mountains, the watch-fires
    of the wandering Bedouins, with whom we hope soon to make a nearer
    acquaintance. We are already preparing for a grand expedition into the
    interior.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

  <p>
    The new Governor, Bugeaud, is determined, it is said, either to
    subjugate or destroy all the hostile tribes. The greatest excitement
    prevails. Fresh troops are landed every day. The Foreign Legion has
    been reorganised: the four battalions of infantry are increased to
    six, and divided into two regiments. Our battalion, the third of
    the first regiment, is commanded by Colonel Von Mollenbeck who has
    succeeded Colonel Von Hulsen. Our new Colonel is a German who has been
    long in the French service. He is brave, but seventy years of age is
    too old for expeditions in Africa. Our regiment has got new muskets
    with percussion locks instead of the old ones.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Governor came a few days ago to inspect us, and was very gracious.
    He appears to be about fifty, and has an air of great determination
    and coolness. He is of the middle size and strongly built; his face
    is much sun-burnt, but pleasing; and he would be taken for younger
    than he is, did not his snow-white hair betray his age. Bugeaud is
    a man of restless activity, and keeps every one on the alert by his
    continual presence. At three every morning he gives audience, to which
    all who have any complaint to make are admitted. Expeditions are to be
    made from several different quarters at once; one from Oran, another
    from Mostaganem, and a third from hence. The Governor will probably
    lead the expedition from Oran himself, and ours will be commanded by
    General Baraguai d’Hilliers, whom the soldiers call the Stumped Arm,
    because he lost the use of his left arm by a shot.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is said that we shall stay here some time longer, and a short rest
    will indeed be most welcome to us. When not on duty, I wander about
    in the neighbourhood, for within the range of the blockhouses one
    is tolerably safe. Every inch of soil is most carefully cultivated,
    chiefly by Spaniards and Arabs; there are also a few Germans who sell
    the produce of their labour, generally fruit and vegetables, for high
    prices at Algiers. The Germans, who are chiefly from Alsatia and
    Rhenish Bavaria, do very well, as they need only work one quarter
    the time they would do in their own country to secure an existence.
    Wherever there is water they can grow three crops of vegetables in
    the year, especially of potatoes which cost more here than figs and
    oranges.

    The day before yesterday I paid my friend Hassan a visit at the Plane
    Tree <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">café</i>, which is only a mile or two from Buterback. He was
    greatly rejoiced to see me again. We retired to his little garden
    behind the house, and, with a smile, he brought out a few bottles of
    Malaga, which we proceeded to pour down our throats whilst we sat on
    the ground after the Eastern fashion conversing most philosophically.
    I had to recount to him all my adventures at Dschigeli, which caused
    him to stroke his beard fiercely, whilst he muttered one <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">caramba</i>

    I have been several times to Algiers, which is about a league and a
    half from Buterback, to take a nearer view of the curiosities there.
  </p>

  <p>
    The upper, which is the old part of the town, bears a striking
    resemblance to the old Moorish cities of Andaluzia, such as Cordova
    and Eccija. The streets are very narrow, and the houses have but few
    windows looking into the streets, and those few are defended by close
    gratings. All the houses are built round a spacious court, which,
    in the dwellings of the rich, is paved with marble and adorned with
    a fountain. The only difference is, that the Spanish cities were
    evidently built during the most flourishing times of the Moors, as the
    style of the houses in Spain is far grander and more ornate than of
    those in Africa.
  </p>

  <p>
    Algiers contains a population of about forty or fifty thousand souls,
    two-thirds of which are Jews and Arabs, and the rest Frenchmen,
    Spaniards, and Italians. The habits of the Jews differ but little from
    those of the Arabs, and one may still perceive that they are children
    of the same forefather. But the sons of Ishmael now seem disposed
    to consider themselves as the lawful descendants of Abraham, and to
    treat the Jews as bastards. The Jews are distinguishable from the
    Arabs by their gayer clothes, and the unveiled faces of their women.
    The Jewesses are far more beautiful than the Arab women, because they
    are not treated as mere domestic animals, and therefore have an air
    of greater refinement. Their dress is simple but pleasing, usually a
    blue or brown garment confined under the breast with a girdle;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> their
    long black hair is held together by a circlet of gold or silver, or by
    a ribbon; their arms and feet are bare. Their deep jet-black eyes are
    wonderfully beautiful, and though their intense brilliancy is somewhat
    softened by the long silken eyelashes, yet woe to him who looks too
    deeply into them.
  </p>

  <p>
    I toiled through the narrow streets up to the Casabah, the former
    residence of the Dey, the road to which is so steep that steps had to
    be cut in it. As I did not know the shortest path, it was at least two
    hours before I reached the top.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Casabah stands on a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i> commanding the whole town.
    Gloomy-looking battlemented walls surround the palace, and are so
    high, as entirely to conceal the building within them; one fine tall
    palm tree alone overtops the wall. The palace contains a beautiful
    marble court and some splendid rooms, in which two French battalions
    are now quartered.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Casabah itself is commanded by a fort built by Charles V. on a
    height above the town. The French were fortunate enough to carry this
    fort by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de main</i>, whereupon the Casabah and the town were
    forced to capitulate. The Dey was living there in the most perfect
    security; all his treasures were deposited in the palace, and he
    was convinced that the high walls of the city would defy all the
    endeavours of the French to take what had already baffled the English
    and the Dutch.
  </p>

  <p>
    The English, under Lord Exmouth, had taken one of the forts upon the
    sea, which they evacuated after twenty-four hours’ possession, upon a
    treaty with the Dey. It is still called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fort Vingt-quatre Heures</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the time of the French occupation, Algiers was strongly fortified;
    besides the thick ramparts, which in some places are double, the town
    was defended by several bastions and three forts, which were in a
    very good state of defence. More especially the batteries on the sea,
    which protect the harbour, were exceedingly strong, and the French
    have since made considerable additions to all the fortifications. The
    town itself, however, from its shape and position, must always remain
    exposed to a bombardment from the sea. The Turks cared but little for
    this contingency, partly because the town contained but few handsome
    houses, and partly because most of the inhabitants were Jews and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
    Arabs. The Dey is said to have asked the English Consul, after its
    bombardment by Lord Exmouth, how much it had cost us; and on hearing
    it put at some millions (of francs?) he frankly replied, that he would
    willingly have done it himself for half the sum.
  </p>

  <p>
    After satisfying my curiosity here, I went into the lower town, and on
    turning down a fresh street I was met by the sound of a mandoline and
    of singing, accompanied by peals of laughter, which issued from the
    second story of one of the houses; the songs were Arab, the laughter
    might be Arab, French, or German, I knew not which, but at all events
    it was most hearty. Of course I walked in, ascended the stairs,
    and found myself in the midst of a mixed company of Arabs, Jews,
    Frenchmen, and Italians, all seated together on cushions against the
    walls of a spacious room.
  </p>

  <p>
    On a sort of platform near the window sat two Arabs singing, with two
    Arab girls beside them accompanying their songs on the mandoline. They
    were at that moment singing a love song, the constant burthen of which
    was “Nanina”; the whole company was in the most joyous mood. Every man
    had one or more bottles of wine before him, and it seemed as if they
    had all drunk repeated bumpers. I was astonished at this wonderful
    advance in civilisation and good fellowship. On either side of me
    I saw Arabs filled with wine, and Arab women with unveiled faces,
    returning the wanton glances of Christians with still more wanton
    eyes. Truly this change does honour to the French.
  </p>

  <p>
    I sat down by an Arab soldier of the French allied cavalry, whose
    burning cheek betrayed that he had transgressed the commandment of
    the Prophet. He immediately drank to me in the most familiar manner,
    saying, with a laugh, “<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Scherap bueno, jaule</i>.” (The wine is good,
    comrade.) “<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Bueno</i>,” answered I; for it was generous Spanish wine,
    such as is chiefly drunk here. He then asked me in broken French,
    whether the women of Europe were equal to its wine? As in duty bound,
    I answered in the affirmative, and described to him the charms and
    the excellence of my countrywomen until my Arab friend seemed well
    inclined to visit Europe. But when I told him that Allah bestowed but
    one wife on us Europeans, he shook his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> head, saying, “<i>Macasch</i>.”
    (Nay, nay.) By this time it was late, and as I had to be at Buterback
    before night I took my leave. The gate Babazoun was soon far behind
    me, and I hastened on towards my destination, for the sun was fast
    declining towards the sea; but the boisterous laughter, and the
    long-drawn burthen of “Na-ni-na” were ringing in my ears the whole way
    home.

  <p class="rightinset">Duera, May, 1841.</p>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Our</span> battalion has been eight days at Duera, a fortified camp on the
    southern declivity of the Sahel, and we expect every moment to start
    on some great expedition. But even here we do not want occupation; for
    nearly every day we have to escort a transport of provisions, intended
    for Blidah, from Delhi Ibrahim to Buffarik.
  </p>

  <p>
    Buffarik is another fortified camp and small village, which stands on
    the river Arrasch in the middle of the plain of Metidja. The soil is
    very productive, but the air so unhealthy that the village has been
    depopulated more than once.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also frequently have to reconnoitre the neighbourhood, and to clear
    it of the Hadjutes. These fellows live in the western part of the
    Sahel, and are notorious for their audacious robberies which they are
    so bold as to extend to within a few leagues of Algiers. A few days
    ago they gave us a strong instance of their daring. On the 1st of
    May, just as we were going to hear mass, in honour of the saint’s-day
    of Louis Philippe, two of the native <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gendarmes maures</i>, who are
    employed as guides, came gallopping up at full speed, their horses’
    flanks bleeding with the spur, and made some communication to the
    Commander of the camp. A general march was immediately sounded, and
    in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> the course of five minutes our battalion was on its way towards a
    blockhouse to the left of Delhi Ibrahim. There was no beaten track,
    and we had to force our way through brushwood as high as ourselves
    with which the mountains are almost everywhere covered—by no means
    an agreeable occupation. We had marched about two leagues and a half
    without stopping, at a pace more like a trot than a walk, when we
    reached a blockhouse occupied by a company of the first battalion of
    our regiment. Here we halted. Lieutenant Colonel Picolou exchanged
    a few words with the officer in command at the blockhouse, and we
    started again immediately. After crossing a deep ravine about a mile
    beyond the blockhouse, the horsemen at the head of our advanced guard
    suddenly drew up and their horses snorted and refused to advance. On
    coming up with them, we saw the cause. About fifty dead bodies, all
    naked and headless, were scattered about. This massacre had evidently
    but just taken place, as the blood was still streaming from their
    necks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some thirty Hadjutes had lured the Captain in command of the
    blockhouse, a Swiss of the name of Müller, to leave it in pursuit
    of them, at the head of fifty of the garrison. At his approach the
    Hadjutes retreated across the ravine, and he was imprudent enough to
    follow them to a spot where he could receive no assistance from the
    blockhouse. He had scarcely reached the other side of the ravine when
    he was surrounded by above six hundred well-mounted Hadjutes. Captain
    Müller and his handful of men defended themselves to the last; many
    of them were separated and cut down singly; but their leader and
    about half of his people instantly formed into a square, and resolved
    to sell their lives as dearly as possible. Their destruction was of
    course inevitable; and their bodies still lay as they fell, side by
    side, and there was not one among them that had not received several
    wounds. The number of dead and wounded horses scattered around showed
    how bravely they had fought. The Hadjutes had, as usual, carried
    away their fallen comrades. Of the fifty soldiers who had left the
    blockhouse one only escaped who, having been wounded at the beginning
    of the fight, had fallen among some thick brushwood, where he had lain
    concealed until the departure of the Hadjutes. He had thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> been a
    spectator of the whole of this horrid scene, and had been forced to
    look on whilst the Hadjutes massacred his comrades and finally cut off
    their heads, which they bore away as trophies hanging to their saddle
    bows.
  </p>

  <p>
    It cannot be denied that Captain Müller caused the destruction of his
    company by his rashness, but he paid for his fault with his life.
    Peace be to his ashes, for he met his death like a man. This scene
    of blood made a deep impression on me, as on all my comrades, whose
    countenances were some burning with rage and thirst for revenge, and
    others pale with terror and disgust. The corpses were immediately
    buried on the spot, the blockhouse garrisoned by a fresh company, and
    we marched back again.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the whole way home I did not hear a single song nor one coarse
    jest, of which there were generally no lack; even the roughest and
    most hardened characters were shaken by that which they had just
    seen.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Every one reflected that the fate of their comrades might one
    day be their own.
  </p>

  <p>
    The blockhouse is about three leagues from Algiers, and one from Delhi
    Ibrahim; so you may judge tolerably well of what is meant by the
    French territory.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">Blidah, June.</p>

  <p>
    On the sixth of May we left Duera for Blidah, the rendezvous appointed
    for the troops which were to form the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">colonne expéditionnaire</i>. For
    several days troops of every description, and an infinite number of
    mules laden with provisions had been passing through Duera.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

  <p>
    After a march of two hours we left the Sahel mountains and descended
    into the plains of Metidja, where we proceeded, much at our ease,
    along a broad road which had been made as far as Blidah for the
    traffic of waggons. The lesser Atlas appeared to lie so close before
    us that we expected to arrive in a few hours at Blidah, the end of
    our day’s march, which lies at the foot of that range. But the great
    height of the mountains deceived us, and it was noon before we reached
    Buffarik which is only half way; here we rested for two hours. Towards
    evening we at last saw Blidah just before us. A thick grove of orange
    trees had till then concealed it from our sight. The white cupolas of
    the numerous mosques, lighted up by the last rays of the setting sun,
    rose from among the bright green foliage of the oranges.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time we reached the town it was nearly dark, and we bivouacked
    under some old olive trees. I lay all night in a sort of waking dream
    and found it impossible to sleep. The soft air of the south, the
    intoxicating perfume of the orange flowers, the death-like stillness,
    rarely disturbed by the neighing of horses and the challenge of the
    sentinels—all this had such a magical effect on my senses, that I
    felt as though I was in the midst of one of the Arabian nights—it was
    not till near morning that I fell asleep, and when I awoke the sun
    was already high in the heavens. As we were to wait there a whole day
    for the arrival of the cavalry, I did not fail to take a nearer view
    of Blidah, which the Arabs justly call the Paradise of Africa. The
    town lies at the very foot of the Atlas, and for miles westward there
    extends a beautiful orange grove, the largest I ever saw, not even
    excepting that of Seville. Eastward, on the slope of the mountain, are
    fig and olive trees, interspersed with cedars which rival those of
    Mount Lebanon. Plentiful streams of water gush out of a ravine, and
    are conveyed in numerous channels through the streets of the town. The
    Arab sits beneath the arcade of his house, protected from the rays of
    the sun, bathing his feet in the cool spring water, and blesses Allah
    and the Prophet for his existence; and well he may, for his days glide
    tranquilly on, like the brook at his feet. Doubts and inward struggles
    are unknown to him; the Arab has but one God, one sword, and one
    horse, and wants nothing more.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

  <p>
    In good and evil fortune he equally says, “The will of Allah be done,”
    and bows his head to the dust. When I compared myself, a restless son
    of the north, to this Arab, truly, for the first time in my life, I
    was envious. But I soon reflected that it is impossible to retrace
    the path I have entered, and that, at the end of the dangers and
    difficulties which beset it, I too may rest beside a cool spring under
    a spreading tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the plain, not very far to the west of Blidah, are the remains of a
    wall which evidently surrounded a town of considerable size. There is
    a tradition that it was destroyed by the Normans. I could never learn
    its name.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the next morning at sunrise the whole column, consisting of about
    twelve thousand men, was in marching order, and the Governor, who had
    arrived with the cavalry the day before, entrusted the command to
    General Baraguai d’Hilliers, and returned to Algiers from whence he
    was to proceed to Oran.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our cavalry consisted, in several squadrons of the native <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gendarmes maures</i>,
    besides a regiment and a half of French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasseurs d’Afrique</i>;
    the latter were all mounted on native horses, as European
    horses are quite worn out in the first half-year. The fourth regiment
    of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasseurs</i>, who had just arrived from Bona, were mounted on Tunis
    horses which the Dey had sold to the French for a very moderate price;
    and nothing can be imagined more beautiful than this regiment. We had
    besides several field-pieces; for granades and grape-shot do more
    execution among masses of cavalry than round-shot: each piece was
    served by four men and drawn by four mules. In the plain they were
    drawn by two mules, but in the mountain districts they were taken to
    pieces, and one mule carried the barrel, another the carriage, and the
    other two the ammunition. It requires only a few minutes to take the
    cannon to pieces and to put it together again.
  </p>

  <p>
    We crossed the plain as far as the foot of the Col de Mussaia, which
    is about four leagues from Blidah, in three columns, surrounded by
    flying squadrons of French and native horse. The baggage, which was
    considerable, was placed in the middle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides what was loaded on mules, each soldier carried nine days’
    provisions, consisting of ship-biscuit, rice, coffee, and sugar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
    Bread and wine are not given on a campaign, owing to the very limited
    means of transport, for it would be impossible to use waggons, and the
    number of mules and donkeys required to carry the provisions for a
    march of five weeks is great enough as it is. Cattle are driven, and
    during an expedition each soldier is allowed double rations, that is,
    one pound of meat daily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides his provisions, which are replaced from time to time, each
    soldier carries sixty rounds of ammunition, and a linen sack into
    which he creeps at night, and which stands him in stead of both an
    upper and under sheet. His only outer garment is the grey <i>capote</i>,
    which protects him against the summer’s heat and the winter’s rain;
    his stock of shirts is usually limited to the one on his back,
    which he washes in the first stream near his bivouac, and which is
    considered dry in ten minutes. The French set but little store by
    other articles of dress, but before they set out on a march they take
    care that each soldier be provided with a pair of good shoes; for
    shoes and arms are the first necessaries of the soldier on active
    service. One may almost say, that to be well shod is even more
    essential than to be well armed; for the soldier can make no use of
    his weapons until he has reached the field of battle. The bravest
    troops are useless if they arrive too late, or leave one-third or half
    of their men lagging behind. It is impossible to lay too much stress
    upon the good marching order of the soldier. Marshal Saxe used to say,
    “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est dans les jambes qu’est tout le secret des manœuvres et des
    combats: c’est aux jambes qu’il faut s’appliquer</i>;” and he was quite right.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Dukes of Nemours and Aumale were with the column; the first
    as Brigadier-General, the latter as Lieutenant-Colonel of the
    twenty-fourth regiment of the line; both are tall and well made.
    The Duke of Nemours generally wears the uniform of the
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasseurs d’Afrique</i>,
    which suits him admirably, and follows the African fashion
    of wearing a thick beard round his mouth and chin; his younger brother
    has not yet followed this laudable example, most likely for the best
    of all reasons.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are both much respected by the army as brave officers; and,
    indeed, they do their duty, on all occasions, even better than the
    other superior officers. The Duke of Nemours, however, is not so
    much beloved as the Duke of Orleans, as he is thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> proud and
    aristocratic, whether justly or not I had no opportunity of telling.
  </p>

  <p>
    The enemy did not attempt to molest us in the plain, although near the
    hills to our left we had constant glimpses of the white bernouses of
    the Bedouins, who, though too weak to make a regular attack, followed
    the column like jackals, and fell upon all that lagged too far in the
    rear.
  </p>

  <p>
    For two years the Metidja has lain waste, but it is still covered
    with ruined dwellings and self-sown corn-fields, the traces of former
    cultivation.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the exception of a few groups of olive trees, little wood is to
    be seen here; only the banks of a small stream called the Schiffa, are
    covered with laurels. We rested for some hours at the foot of the Col
    de Mussaia, before the column began to ascend the mountain.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the only pass in all this part of the lesser Atlas. The
    defiles in this narrow pass had been occupied by a few battalions of
    infantry the day before, as, without this precaution, the Bedouins
    might have crushed the whole army by merely throwing blocks of stone
    down the perpendicular rocks upon the troops defiling along the narrow
    path below.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mountain scenery here is most wildly romantic: on the left are
    towering rocks, on the right a dizzy precipice; as far as the eye can
    reach there is nothing but tall brushwood, with a few olive trees and
    cedars wherever the soil is deep enough. No trace of human habitations
    was to be seen, the place appeared to be the abode of vultures and
    jackals, both of which abound. However, we afterwards learnt that
    the huts of the Kabyles are thickly scattered in all the defiles and
    glens, but they are so small and dingy as not to be visible from a
    distance.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the foot of the Col de Mussaia up to its highest point is fully
    seven hours’ march; and as the day was intensely hot, we shed many a
    drop of sweat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our battalion, which was the only one of the Foreign Legion engaged in
    this expedition, formed the rear guard, and we did not reach the top
    of the mountain until long after sunset.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other troops had already encamped for the night, and we were sent
    on as outposts to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fontaine de la Croix</i>, a full league further,
    on the other declivity of the mountain. We went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> forward, limping and
    cursing. To make matters still worse, a guide was sent with us who did
    not know the way. At length, some time past midnight, the sound of
    rushing waters announced to us that we had reached our destination.
    This <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fontaine de la Croix</i> derives its name from a huge cross cut
    into the living rock, probably by the Spaniards, as a pious memorial
    of their conquest. We had not much time for rest, as the signal for
    marching was given before sunrise. We were now the first of the
    advanced guard, and on we went, up hill and down dale. The Bedouins
    made an attempt to fire upon the column in a large olive grove,
    through which we had to pass at the foot of the Col, but our scouts
    and sharp-shooters soon drove them off.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">Medeah.</p>

  <p>
    We reached Medeah, the end of our day’s march, before noon. This city,
    one of the oldest in Africa, stands on a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i>, which terminates
    on two sides in an abrupt precipice, and is therefore easily defended.
    The town is surrounded by the most splendid fruit gardens; a Roman
    aqueduct still in good preservation, conveys water to it from a
    neighbouring mountain, and proves the high antiquity of the town. It
    is inhabited by Jews and Arabs, who seem devoted to the French—a
    disposition greatly encouraged by the presence of a French garrison
    of two battalions. Medeah was formerly the capital of the Beylick of
    Titteri, and the residence of the Bey.
  </p>

  <p>
    We pitched our tents close to the town, beside a brook, where
    exquisite oranges, out of a garden close by, offered us some
    compensation for the fatigues we had undergone.
  </p>

  <p>
    In spite of positive commands to the contrary, the soldiers proceeded
    to cut down the orange and almond trees for fuel, although there were
    plenty of large olive trees in the neighbourhood; but destruction is
    the proper element of the soldier.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our bivouac usually forms a perfect square, modified of course by the
    ground; the infantry, who are outside, lie in double file behind their
    piled arms. Each battalion sends out one company as an advanced post,
    and another company remains within the lines as a picket. The baggage,
    artillery, and cavalry, are placed in the middle. The cavalry do not
    furnish any outposts, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> horsemen, especially in broken ground, are
    too much exposed to the fire of the Bedouins and Kabyles, who steal
    singly towards us. The infantry, on the contrary, can more easily hide
    themselves, and by laying their faces close to the ground can hear the
    slightest sound. This is essential, as the Bedouins and Kabyles creep
    on all fours like wild beasts and fall upon single outposts, or shoot
    them from a distance when they can see them; for which reason the
    outposts change their ground after dark, to deceive the enemy. They
    generally draw back a little, leaving their watch-fires burning, which
    enables them to see whatever passes between them and the fire. To our
    great satisfaction we stayed the whole of the next day at Medeah, as
    the General had directed many military stores and other matters to be
    forwarded thither. As it was Sunday, a solemn mass was celebrated on
    an eminence in the middle of the camp, by a priest who accompanied
    us, and who afterwards preached a very edifying sermon on peace. We
    were unfortunately so far from the priest that we heard nothing of the
    whole mass but an occasional solemn strain of military music.
  </p>

  <p>
    We started next morning before sunrise, and continued our route due
    south. We marched several days without exchanging a single shot with
    the Bedouins. Our road lay always up or down hill; the heat was
    excessive and our marches were at the rate of from four to six leagues
    a-day.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Africa it is, of course, impossible to say where or when the troops
    are to bivouac, as it depends upon finding wood and water. In case of
    need the wood can be dispensed with, as there is almost always enough
    to be found for cooking; but water is absolutely necessary for the
    cattle and the beasts of burden, which die if they get none after a
    long march; men can bear the want of it better. Of course, the General
    has several native guides who know the country, which is the more
    essential as the French have never been in this part of Africa before.
  </p>

  <p>
    Had we not seen well-cultivated corn, barley, and rice fields in the
    valleys, we should have supposed that the whole of this district was
    uninhabited. As far as our cavalry scoured the country they found no
    traces of human beings save a few miserable little hovels made of
    rushes and skins of beasts, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> we should have thought too wretched
    for a dog to live in. The owners, of course, were nowhere to be found.
    In former days this tract of country must have been thickly peopled,
    judging from the cemeteries which we saw from time to time. These
    were generally near the tomb of a marabout, and of enormous extent:
    they might truly be called cities of the dead. The graves were all
    exactly alike; no distinction seemed to exist among the dead. All were
    carefully covered with masonry, to keep the jackals from scratching up
    the bodies; and indeed no one can wonder that the Bedouins should wish
    to rest undisturbed in death after such restless wandering lives. Each
    grave was marked by a large upright stone, but no date told the dying
    day of him who lay beneath it, no escutcheon proclaimed his birth and
    descent.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bedouins, who are nomadic here as elsewhere, are too poor to buy
    tents, and accordingly they build for themselves in a few days the
    wretched hovels I have already mentioned. And the French make war
    upon these wretched houseless tribes! Truly, they might as well march
    against the jackals.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bedouins had placed vedettes on the tops of all the mountains
    to give notice of our approach. We could distinctly perceive on the
    distant hills, single horsemen in white bernouses who retreated as we
    drew near them.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were now in the province of Titteri, among the mountains of
    the second Atlas range, which at this point is not divided by any
    considerable rivers or valleys from the lesser Atlas. It is impossible
    to tell where the one ceases and the other begins: all is mountain.
    Farther west, on the contrary, the extensive plain watered by the
    Schellif forms the natural division.
  </p>

  <p>
    After several days’ march the mountains which had hitherto been
    covered with mere brushwood became more wooded and romantic in their
    appearance. We passed through immense forests of olives, firs, and
    junipers, the latter of which grew to a considerable height. A great
    fire must have raged in one part of the forest, as nearly all the
    trees about it were black and charred. Some of them, however, still
    had so much vital power left that they had shot out afresh at top. Our
    column followed a caravan track through the wood.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is remarkable that on the very highest point of all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
    mountains there stands a marabout. These marabouts are at the same
    time the temples and the mausoleums of the Bedouin priests, who are
    also called marabouts. They are usually small,—from thirty or forty
    feet square,—surmounted by a cupola, and commonly built of rough
    stone and whitewashed. Thus these houseless children of the desert,
    who have no abiding-place for themselves, yet build a house for their
    God.
  </p>

  <p>
    One day our company was detached in order to cover the right flank; we
    were separated as sharp-shooters, and our road lay near one of these
    marabouts. The door was open, and curiosity impelled me and a few
    others to enter. We stepped in, and saw an old man in a white bernouse
    prostrate on the ground praying. It was indeed a spot well fitted for
    prayer and meditation; here, on the graves of his forefathers, so near
    to heaven, everything proclaimed the transitory nature of earthly
    things and the greatness and majesty of the Eternal.
  </p>

  <p>
    As some of us approached him and made a noise, the priest arose and
    motioned us back with his hand, saying, “<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">No bueno Romis</i>” (not well
    Christians). We involuntarily drew back. The whole appearance of this
    man was that of an inspired prophet. We afterwards joked about it, but
    no one could conceive how this man came to be in a place so far from
    all human habitations. The Arabs and Bedouins call all Christians and
    Europeans by the name of Romis, <em>i. e.</em> Romans.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not know whether the jackals are particularly numerous in this
    district, or whether it is that they follow our column, but every
    evening after sunset they serenade us most melodiously. The jackal
    is not unlike our European fox, but it feeds chiefly on corpses and
    carrion, and is therefore dangerous only to the dead.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is curious that the hoarse croaking bark of the hyæna is always
    heard together with the howling of the jackal. The natives assert
    that every pack of jackals is led by a hyæna. These serenades are not
    very enlivening. But though the howling of hyænas and jackals was my
    regular lullabye, and my knapsack my only pillow, I did not sleep a
    whit the less soundly after a good day’s march.
  </p>

  <p>
    By degrees the country grew more and more desert and treeless. The
    hills were bare and the valleys afforded but little water, and that
    little was fetid. The streams were already dried up;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> in the deepest
    places a little water was still standing, but it was so bitter that it
    could scarcely be used for cooking. It was only here and there that
    we found fresh springs. We suffered cruelly from heat and thirst:
    each man filled his flask every morning, but the water was soon drunk
    during a forced march, and it is not every one that knows how to make
    the most of it. During the first part of the day as little as possible
    should be drunk, and even later a very small quantity, and that only
    while at rest; much drinking merely heats and weakens. When we halted
    at mid-day and found water we generally made some coffee, which even
    without sugar or milk was most refreshing. Before starting in the
    morning we usually drink coffee, in which we soak our biscuit. In the
    evening we make soup of the meat which is given out; so, you see, we
    cannot be accused of gluttony at any rate. But, indeed, this heat
    takes away all appetite, and one longs for nothing but a shady tree
    and a gushing fountain; all else is vain.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is strange to see the efforts made by every creature when we are
    coming near a spring or a brook to reach it quickly. The weary faces
    of the soldiers resume their animation; the horses and mules who smell
    the water half a league off begin to neigh: and on reaching the water
    both men and beasts plunge into it, to satisfy their burning thirst.
    General orders and sentinels are of no avail; what is punishment or
    even death to the soldier at such a moment! He would much rather die
    by a bullet than by thirst. Most of them lose all self-control, and
    drink till they are literally full. I have seen some of them drink
    with a small tin can called a <em>quart</em>, which each soldier carries
    hanging to his button-hole, as much as five or six pints at a time.
    It is extraordinary that more do not die of it; but the water is
    generally warmed by the sun, and the subsequent marching brings on
    profuse perspiration.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">Callah.</p>

  <p>
    Here, where one would least expect to find human beings, the Bedouins
    have begun to show themselves in great numbers, and to attack the
    flanks and the rear of the column. Perhaps they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> have been retreating
    before us all this time, and now that we draw near the lesser desert
    they are determined to retreat no further. By degrees their numbers
    increased, and without offering any resistance to the head of the
    column they hovered round us all day, greeting us with wild yells of
    “<em>Lu, lu</em>,” which probably meant “Allah.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They gallop without any order, and singly, to within eighty or a
    hundred paces of our sharp shooters, and discharge their rifles at
    full speed. The horse then turns of his own accord, and the rider
    loads his piece as he retreats; and this is repeated again and again
    all day long.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bedouins never wait for a close encounter hand to hand when
    charged by our cavalry; they disperse in all directions, but instantly
    return. The only difference between them and the Numidians, of whom
    Sallust says, “They fight flying, and retreat, only to return more
    numerous than before,” is, that the Numidians of old fought with bows
    and the Bedouins have rifles.
  </p>

  <p>
    This kind of fighting is equally dangerous and fatiguing to us. It is
    no joke to be firing in all directions from sunrise till sunset, and
    to march at the same time, for we seldom halt to fight at our ease.
    The General only orders a halt when the rear-guard is so fiercely
    attacked as to require reinforcement. Any soldier of the rear-guard
    who is wounded or tired has the pleasant prospect of falling into the
    hands of the Bedouins and having his head cut off by them. One comfort
    is, that this operation is speedily performed: two or three strokes
    with the yataghan are a lasting cure for all pains and sorrows.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are, it is true, a certain number of mules and litters to carry
    the sick and wounded; but on so long an expedition as this the number
    of the sick increases to such a degree that in the end every means
    of conveyance is overloaded. The only resource, then, is to unload
    the provision mules, and to distribute rations for eight or ten days
    more among the soldiers. In the end, however, both men and mules are
    dead beat, and every one must shift for himself. It requires long
    habit, and much suffering, before a man can bear to see his comrades
    butchered before his eyes without being able to help them.
  </p>

  <p>
    For several successive days we were attacked with such pertinacity by
    the Bedouins, and their allies the Kabyles, that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> supposed we must
    be coming upon their den, and so indeed it turned out. One evening,
    after a hot forced march, we saw on a mountain top, which formed a
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i>, a great heap of stones which we knew to be a town. In two
    hours we were close upon it. Our battalion and several others climbed
    the steep hill, in order to enter the town from above, while the rest
    of the column attacked it from below. We were driving the Bedouins
    before us all the time. At length we reached the walls, which were low
    and battlemented, but to our astonishment no one appeared to defend
    them, and the gates stood wide open. Suspecting a stratagem, some of
    us climbed to the top of the walls to look into the town. The nest was
    empty, and the birds flown; as usual we had come just too late. The
    whole column poured into the town, which was I think called Callah,
    and the soldiers eagerly ransacked the houses. The owners could not
    have been gone long, for the kuskussu on the hearth was still hot.
    A few fowls, cats, and lambs, which the Kabyles had left behind in
    their hurry, and two rusty cannons, were all the spoil. A far greater
    god-send was a fine spring of water near the city gates. Here we made
    up for the thirst we had endured all day.
  </p>

  <p>
    After taking as much wood as was wanted to cook our supper, we set
    fire to the town. We then bivouacked on an eminence at a distance,
    where we slept as soundly as if we had performed some glorious action.
  </p>

  <p>
    The soldiers began to grow impatient; we were now close to the lesser
    desert, without apparently being a bit the nearer to Abd-el-Kader’s
    castle, which was the object of the expedition. They began as usual
    to invent the most extraordinary theories, some asserting that the
    General had sold us to Abd-el-Kader, others that we were in a few days
    to fight a battle against the Emperor of Morocco, although we were
    then further from Morocco than from Algiers.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">The Lesser Desert.</p>

  <p>
    One morning before leaving our bivouac, we were ordered to fill our
    kettles with water, and to carry some wood upon our knapsacks, as we
    should have to pass the night in the desert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> After two hours’ march
    the desert lay before us, and a most cheerless prospect did it afford.
    To the south nothing was to be seen but an undulating surface of
    shifting sand: on the east and west alone, the Atlas range was still
    visible.
  </p>

  <p>
    The palm grows better than any other tree in this scorching soil; but
    it was only from time to time that we found one, and then so stunted
    and withered was it that it could afford no shelter to the weary
    wanderer. The palm is seldom found in groups, generally single, or at
    most in twos and threes, for which reason the natives call the palm
    tree the hermit.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had of course no idea how far the desert might extend, and felt as
    desolate and fearful as the young sailor who for the first time sees
    his native shore fade from his sight. To our great joy we soon turned
    westward, always following the track of a caravan. The march was
    excessively fatiguing, as no breath of air tempered the burning heat
    under which we toiled alone, up to the ancles in sand. I was so tired,
    that I could have exclaimed with King Richard, “A horse! a horse! my
    kingdom for a horse.” Towards evening we reached a spot which the
    Bedouins had but lately quitted, as we saw by the traces of tents and
    herds. To our great joy we found several deep cisterns containing some
    water, not indeed fit to drink, but good enough for cattle and for
    cooking. These cisterns are filled during the rainy season, and some
    water remains in them till far into the summer. Next day we turned
    still more to the west, and towards evening we reached the foot of the
    mountains, where we bivouacked beside a brook, whose waters had called
    forth luxuriant vegetation. We were not a little rejoiced to escape
    from the accursed desert. Many of us had already bidden adieu to life,
    and fancied that we saw our bones lie bleaching on the burning sand.
  </p>

  <p>
    The green banks of this small stream where we lay seemed to us a
    perfect paradise. On the following morning we followed the course
    of the brook upwards with more than usual speed, preceded at some
    distance by the cavalry, whence we supposed something must be in
    store for us. Towards mid-day some Bedouins showed themselves one by
    one on our right flank, and discharged their rifles at the column.
    As the whole body of cavalry had been sent forward, sharp-shooters
    were detached, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> succeeded in keeping the Bedouins at a respectful
    distance. By degrees, however, they came in greater numbers, and grew
    bolder, so that our sharp-shooters had to be constantly reinforced and
    relieved. It is most fortunate for us that the Bedouins have such
    a holy horror of the bayonet. The sharp-shooter may feel perfectly
    secure against an attack hand to hand with the yataghan from any
    single Bedouin.
  </p>

  <p>
    They confine themselves to swearing and shooting at him, both always
    at full gallop; and as the aim of a horseman is far less certain than
    that of a foot soldier, the sharp-shooter has the advantage. The
    Bedouins fight hand to hand only when they are greatly superior in
    numbers, or when a small band is cut off from the main body; then,
    indeed, the danger is very great.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">Thaza.</p>

  <p>
    Towards evening we at length saw on a height before us the castle of
    Abd-el-Kader, the object of our expedition. It was a large square
    building in the European style, surrounded with high walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    Close to it blazed a village which the Bedouins had fired with their
    own hands. The cavalry had taken the castle without a single blow, for
    the Arabs had just deserted it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every soul had fled, leaving nothing but bare walls. We had again
    arrived too late, and I thought of the words of my friend Hassan,
    “Quickness is the soul of war.” I am convinced that we are very
    deficient in cavalry, more especially in native horsemen, who know
    every hole and corner in the defiles, and whose horses can scramble
    anywhere. Our cavalry is not nearly strong enough to act for several
    days independently of infantry and artillery. Possibly, too, the
    General was not particularly well served by his spies and guides, or
    some one of those thousand accidents may have occurred which cause the
    failure of even the best laid plans.
  </p>

  <p>
    We bivouacked immediately under the castle walls, for it was late, and
    both men and horses were too tired to pursue the enemy. We all rushed
    into the castle to see the inside, and, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> possible, to plunder; but
    nothing was left except a good many sheepskins and a few carpets.
  </p>

  <p>
    The whole construction of the castle plainly showed that it had
    been built under the direction of European architects. The rooms of
    the Emir alone were arranged in the Arabian manner. The European
    prisoners had been confined in the vaults below, where we found the
    names of people of all nations written on the walls. Some bewailed
    that we should come too late, and that they were to be transferred to
    some other dungeon, they knew not where. Many prisoners of condition
    had been shut up there; among others, a French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sous Intendant</i>,
    who had been seized by a horde of Bedouins near Duera, not far from
    Algiers. This man was afterwards sent back without ransom, upon the
    intercession of the Bishop of Algiers, who wrote to Abd-el-Kader
    about him. It is but just to add, that the prisoners of Abd-el-Kader,
    who were subsequently released, said that he had treated them very
    humanely. It is true that they worked at his buildings, but they had
    enough to eat, and were not beaten. As soon however as the Emir was
    gone on a distant expedition, they were shamefully ill-used, and after
    a hard day’s work got only a handful of barley and a little oil,—a
    poor repast for those accustomed to the strong meat of the north. I
    have since met with a Dutchman who had passed three years in this
    slavery, at the end of which he was exchanged: hunger and misery had
    rendered him completely imbecile. He had lost all sense of taste and
    smell, and swallowed indiscriminately everything that was placed
    before him, whether good or bad.
  </p>

  <p>
    We stayed here the following day to rest. The cavalry went out to
    reconnoitre whether any of the Bedouins still lay hidden in the
    defiles and valleys, but returned without having found any traces of
    them. These people have a peculiar art of driving away large herds of
    cattle with incredible rapidity. The engineers completely destroyed
    the castle by blowing up the walls, and setting all the wood that was
    in it on fire.
  </p>

  <p>
    To the great joy of us all, a march back to Milianah was ordered. But
    before reaching the plains of the Schellif we had to cross the arm of
    the Uanseris mountains, at the cost of infinite suffering and fatigue.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

  <p>
    On the second day we came to a defile, at least five leagues in
    length, and so narrow that in many places we had to march in single
    file. On either hand rose lofty and precipitous rocks, which the
    infantry were forced to occupy and defend.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before daybreak these positions were taken without much difficulty,
    for the Bedouins had already deserted them. The infantry and cavalry,
    posted on the heights on either side of the pass, covered the advance
    of the column, and the main body and the artillery began to defile
    through; this took so much time that the head of the column had
    already debouched before the rear had begun to move. It is scarcely
    conceivable how, with the column drawn out over at least five leagues
    of ground, we escaped without a mishap.
  </p>

  <p>
    Considerable masses of cavalry showed themselves on our right flank,
    and made several attacks on us, but all so feeble and unconnected that
    they were easily repulsed. We bivouacked upon a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i> on the side
    of the defile, but the rear-guard did not reach the spot until late
    in the evening. In a few days more we reached the Schellif, which
    the natives call the great river,—a name it by no means deserves at
    this place, where it is small and insignificant; but the youthful
    impetuosity with which it dashes over rocks and hollows gives promise
    of its future size. We followed its course for several days, marching
    sometimes on the right, sometimes on the left bank, on account of the
    narrowness of the valley; and having no pontoons with us, we had the
    pleasure of wading through the stream several times a day.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rivers in Africa are seldom so deep as not to be fordable; but
    the health of the soldiers is destroyed by constantly marching in wet
    clothes, more especially in the morning and evening when they do not
    soon dry. I am convinced that many illnesses, particularly fevers and
    diarrhœa, are brought on by this. Besides, the soldiers’ feet suffer
    terribly from the softening of the skin and the hardening of the shoes.
  </p>

  <p>
    By dint of scouring the country in all directions, our cavalry at last
    succeeded in surprising a tribe and taking two or three prisoners and
    a few hundred sheep, which barely supplied us with meat for one day.
    It was fortunate that we had such a quantity of live stock with us,
    for we must otherwise have died of hunger. As it was, our poor oxen
    were grown so thin, owing to forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> marches and want of food, that
    Pharaoh’s lean kine would have seemed fat in comparison.
  </p>

  <p>
    By-and-by we reached the end of the Uanseris mountains, where the
    valley of the Schellif widens into an extensive plain which we found
    covered with corn, although no tents or huts were to be seen. As the
    wheat and barley were still too green to burn, the column deployed to
    its utmost breadth, so as at all events to trample down the crops as
    much as possible.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">Milianah.</p>

  <p>
    The further side of the plain is skirted by the lesser Atlas range, on
    the southern declivity of which stands Milianah, whose white walls and
    mosques we distinctly saw from afar.
  </p>

  <p>
    Towards evening we reached the foot of these mountains, and bivouacked
    immediately under Milianah. On the following day, whatever ammunition
    and provisions we had remaining, about eight days’ supply, were sent
    into the town. Immediately above Milianah is the highest point of the
    lesser Atlas, and the town is built half way up the mountain, on a
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i>, which falls abruptly on three sides. This was formerly the
    residence of Abd-el-Kader, who showed great judgment in the choice of
    a spot so easily defensible and commanding the fruitful plain of the
    Schellif. A beautiful clear stream which gushes out of a hollow above
    the town, runs through the streets, and serves to work the powder
    mills and manufactories established by Abd-el-Kader.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1840, when the war broke out between Abd-el-Kader and the
    French, Milianah was besieged and taken by the latter. One half of
    the besiegers assailed the town from below, while the rest having
    succeeded in planting some cannon on a height commanding the town,
    poured their shot down upon it. When Abd-el-Kader saw that he could
    hold the place no longer, he determined to retreat by the only gate
    which was still free, and first rode sword in hand through the
    streets, cutting down every one that would not follow him. Nearly all
    effected their retreat in safety, and most of the families settled
    on the northern slope of the lesser Atlas. The town contains few
    buildings worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> looking at, except the palace of the Emir. The French
    have repaired and considerably strengthened the fortifications of the
    place.
  </p>

  <p>
    With Milianah Abd-el-Kader lost the valley of the Schellif, and was
    compelled to retire as far as the Mina. He transported his wives and
    children and his most valued property to Tekedemta, a rocky fastness
    in the greater Atlas, beyond Mascara.
  </p>

  <p>
    From Milianah the column marched towards the Col de Mussaia, which
    we had to pass again. Next morning, when we were still about twenty
    leagues from this accursed Col, General Changarnier was sent in
    advance with four battalions of infantry, of which ours was one, some
    cavalry, and a few field-pieces to occupy the positions in the pass.
    Those who were not in good walking order were left behind with the
    column. We started at four in the morning, and marched the whole day,
    only halting for ten minutes at a time, till we reached the
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Plateau des Reguliers</i>,
    (so called from Abd-el-Kader’s regular troops, who
    often encamp there,) which lies at the foot of the Col. Evening had
    already begun to close in. The day had been excessively hot, and the
    forced march had fatigued us so much, that it was absolutely necessary
    to halt and to give the soldiers time to cook their soup and to
    recover a little. In two hours we were to start afresh. The soldiers
    were indignant at such an unusually long and rapid march, and railed
    at the harshness and cruelty of the General, who they said sacrificed
    his men to a mere caprice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The soldiers, of course, could not see the need for such excessive
    haste; some poor fellows moreover had been left on the road for want
    of mules to carry them. I several times heard the exclamation, “I wish
    that the Bedouins would grow out of the ground by millions and put an
    end to us all.” The fatigues and hardships of this kind of war at last
    produce perfect indifference to life, which becomes a mere burden.
    Indeed it is an old saying, “That nothing is better calculated to
    render the soldier careless of danger than fatigue and privation.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When Sylla was made commander of the Roman forces against Mithridates,
    he found the Roman legions so enervated by ease and luxury that they
    were afraid to face the enemy; but Sylla worked them and marched them
    about till they besought him to lead them to battle. He then attacked
    the enemy and beat them.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

  <p>
    General Changarnier, who commanded us, is known by the whole army as a
    brave soldier who exacts the very utmost from others as well as from
    himself, and who accordingly most often succeeds in his enterprises.
    He is more feared than loved by the men; who say,
    “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est un homme dur ce Changarnier</i>.”
    He appears to be a few years above fifty, powerfully
    built, but with a head somewhat weather-beaten by the storms of life.
    He has been fighting in Africa ever since the first occupation.
  </p>

  <p>
    After two hours’ rest, when night had completely closed in, we started
    again in perfect silence, and left our watch-fires burning to make
    the enemy believe that we were going to bivouac on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i>; we
    wound up the mountain, which is far steeper on this side than even on
    the other. This night was one of the most painful of my whole life.
    The oppressive heat and forced march had so exhausted us that we
    marched more asleep than awake, and were only roused by striking our
    feet against a stone, or our noses against the knapsack of the man
    before us. From time to time we were reminded of our danger by the
    order “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Serrez! serrez!</i>” and indeed it was necessary to keep close,
    for whoever lagged behind was lost. We all dropped down asleep during
    the short stoppages which inevitably took place at the difficult
    passages; and without doubt we left behind us many sleepers, who were
    not perceived by the rear-guard and instantly fell a prey to the
    Bedouins. About four o’clock in the morning we passed the
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fontaine de la Croix</i>,
    where we bivouacked on our former march; thus we still had
    a league to march before reaching the highest point of the Col. From
    this spot the battalions separated, in order to ascend the various
    heights. By five we were at the top, almost without firing a shot.
  </p>

  <p>
    These positions are so impregnable that the Bedouins could have driven
    us back merely with stones if they had had any resolution. I am
    convinced that the Kabyles of Budschia and Dschigeli would have sent
    us home in a fine plight. As we had to wait for the arrival of the
    main body, we established ourselves on the mountain top as well as we
    could. Greatly to our annoyance, however, no water was to be found in
    the neighbourhood, and we were obliged to fetch it a whole league from
    the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fontaine de la Croix</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Towards mid-day, when the fog cleared off, we discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> the blue
    Mediterranean beyond the plain of Metidja and the Sahel mountains. We
    greeted it as our second home, with loud cheers and cries of “Land,”
    for the sea was to us what the harbour is to the sailor after a long
    and perilous voyage. From this point, one of the highest of the lesser
    Atlas, we enjoyed the most glorious prospect. On one side we saw the
    vast plain of Metidja and the sea beyond it; on the other, several
    small valleys, where pastures still green proved the fruitfulness
    of the soil. In one of these little valleys we espied a few huts
    and a flock of sheep grazing in peaceful ignorance of their danger.
    This time the poor inhabitants of the hovels were protected by their
    poverty: had the prey been better worth taking, a division of cavalry
    would soon have been down upon them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sharp and broken outlines of the mountains and the dark foliage
    of the olives, pines, and cedars, which clothe their sides, give a
    singularly wild and sombre character to the Atlas range. The air at
    this height is sharp and piercing even in summer; and while we could
    scarcely breathe for the heat below, we here buttoned our capotes
    up to our very chins. This appeared to be the land of vultures and
    eagles, which soared and screamed around us by hundreds, apparently
    highly offended at their unexpected guests. They came so near to us
    that several of them were shot by the soldiers with split bullets;
    but they were a perverse and stiff-necked generation, which even when
    mortally wounded did not cease from biting and clawing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main body arrived towards evening, and on the following morning we
    continued our march towards the Metidja, with great alacrity and good
    humour. Our knapsacks were light, and the prospect of making up at
    Blidah for the hardships we had undergone infused new life into all of
    us.
  </p>

  <p>
    At noon we were already at the foot of the mountains, and a few hours
    later the mosques and orange groves of Blidah lay before us.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was indeed high time for us to return to the camp, for the number
    of sick had increased frightfully of late; horses, mules, and donkeys
    were all overloaded with them, and many a one who would long since
    have been given over by the physicians in Europe still crawled in
    our ranks. Our shoes and clothes were in rags; many even had wound
    pieces of ox hide about their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> feet in default of shoes. We bivouacked
    close by the town on the bank of a small brook. All the people in
    the town came out to see us and to convince themselves that we were
    still alive, for it had been reported several times that the column
    was utterly destroyed. They lifted up their hands in amazement at
    our deplorable appearance; and it was only on comparing ourselves
    with these sleek and well-fed citizens that we perceived how wild and
    wretched we looked, and that our faces were dingy yellow, and our
    bodies dried up like so many mummies. I am convinced, that except on
    the persons of the attendants on the sick, and some of the superior
    officers, not even Shylock himself could have cut one pound of flesh
    out of the whole column.
  </p>

  <p>
    Arabs, Jews, and Christians vied with each other in offering us wine,
    fruit, bread, &amp;c., at very sufficient prices, for in Africa nothing is
    gratis.
  </p>

  <p>
    All discipline was now at an end: the officers were soon dispersed
    among the various <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafés</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">restaurants</i>, and the soldiers bought
    as much bread, fruit, and wine as they could get for their few <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sous</i>,
    and seated themselves under the first shady tree they could find,
    where they drank till all the miseries of life were forgotten.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">After</span> stopping eight days to repair the state of our arms and shoes,
    the column marched again to provision Milianah, and to lay waste the
    plains of the Schellif with fire and sword. All the cavalry, save two
    squadrons, were dismounted, and their horses loaded with all sorts of
    provisions, rice, meal, coffee, sugar, &amp;c. As we left Blidah rather
    late, we were forced to pass the night on this side of the Col de
    Mussaia, in an olive grove at the foot of the mountain. In all my life
    I never saw so many small birds as in this grove; it was positively
    alive with them. They twittered and warbled in all tongues; the
    bullfinches especially delighted me with a melody so like that which
    they sing in my own country, that I fancied I recognised some old
    acquaintances among them. The soldiers contrived to catch a number
    of young birds, who, dreaming of no danger had ventured out of their
    nests, and to cook them for supper.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the following day we ascended the Col; not indeed without fatigue,
    but with infinitely less than the first time, for we were already
    steeled by habit. We bivouacked on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Plateau des Reguliers</i>, at the
    opposite foot of the mountain.
  </p>

  <p>
    We reached the plains of the Schellif in two days without molestation.
    The heat began to be intolerable to us in this region, bare of
    trees, and surrounded by high mountains, which shut out every breath
    of air. Towards mid-day we could scarcely breathe, and many of our
    number perished from thirst and fatigue, some died on the spot; they
    suddenly fell down backwards, foaming at the mouth, and clenching
    their hands convulsively, and in ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> minutes they were dead. To add
    to our distresses, a body of three or four thousand Arab horsemen
    appeared on our left flank, headed by Abd-el-Kader in person. We were
    in the most awkward position in the world; all our cavalry, save two
    squadrons, was dismounted, and the column scattered over a space of
    at least two leagues. I am convinced that if Abd-el-Kader had made a
    determined attack upon us at that moment he might have annihilated
    the whole column. Instead of this, only a few irregular parties of
    horsemen galloped towards us, discharged their rifles, and retreated.
    Once or twice a considerable number of Arabs assembled together, as
    if preparing to attack us. But our General immediately ordered some
    grenades to be thrown among them out of a few field-pieces, and the
    whole body was scattered like chaff before the wind. This want of
    resolution in our enemies was extraordinary, for Abd-el-Kader must
    have known our position, and even if he had not a single spy, he
    could perceive it with his own eyes. We saw him several times within
    musket-shot, galloping about with his attendants, to give orders. I
    believe that this inaction was owing to no want of courage or capacity
    in him, but to the character of the Bedouins, and to their peculiar
    mode of warfare, which nothing can induce them to alter. They never
    attack <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>, except when they can overwhelm the enemy with their
    numbers. By this practice the Bedouins have drawn upon themselves the
    reproach of cowardice from the French; whether with justice is not for
    me to decide; but I think that much might be said on behalf of the
    Bedouins.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is quite true that they have no courage collectively. The reason
    is, that they want those ties by which masses are held together,—a
    higher degree of civilisation, and a leading idea,—either love of
    a common country, or religious enthusiasm. The former is unknown to
    the Bedouin, whose tribe is his country, and whose next neighbour is
    often his bitterest foe: he is never, like the Arab, deeply imbued
    with religion; to him Allah is a mere god of plundering and murder.
    To these causes is added the custom of a thousand years; these tribes
    have known no other mode of warfare since the days of the Numidians.
    The Bedouin conception of bravery and of cowardice is totally unlike
    ours. He sees no cowardice in retreating before a superior force,
    and returning to the charge at a more favourable opportunity, but
    necessary pru<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>dence—a quality which stands as high in his estimation
    as valour. The Bedouin would never shrink from the European in single
    combat, and frequently surpasses him in endurance of privations, and
    even of death, which he meets with the resignation of a philosopher.
  </p>

  <p>
    We afterwards heard that Abd-el-Kader had endeavoured by every means
    in his power to induce the chiefs to make a regular and organised
    attack upon the column, but all in vain. That very evening we reached
    the foot of the mountains just below Milianah, and the favourable
    moment for attacking us was past.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader is a handsome man of about thirty-seven or thirty-eight.
    Although dressed in the common Bedouin bernouse and turban, he was
    easily distinguishable from his attendants by the splendor of his arms
    and of his horses. Even from a distance I thought I could trace on his
    dark and bearded countenance the intrepidity and religious enthusiasm
    by which he is distinguished. His bearing was proud and noble. I could
    not help watching this man with a certain degree of admiration, for he
    alone is the soul of the whole resistance to the French; without him
    no three tribes would act in common. I heartily wished him a better
    fate; for his lot will be either to fall in battle, or to be betrayed
    by his friends, like Jugurtha, to whom he may well be compared,
    although to equal courage and perseverance he unites an elevation
    of character not ascribed to the Numidian of old by historians, who
    indeed were nowise impartial.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader has strictly forbidden his soldiers to kill the prisoners
    in cold blood, and in order to put a stop to this practice among the
    Bedouins, he pays ten Spanish dollars for every living captive. The
    Emir received an almost European education from his father, who was
    a marabout highly venerated by the people, and who lived for several
    years in Italy, where he became acquainted with European habits and
    manners.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader exercises great influence over both the Bedouins and the
    Arabs, from being their ecclesiastical as well as temporal ruler: he
    is the Khaleefeh (Vicegerent of the Prophet). I have seen one of the
    Arabs of our own allied cavalry reverentially touch the earth with
    his brow on hearing the name of Abd-el-Kader; but his veneration
    would nowise have deterred him from murdering or taking prisoner the
    Khaleefeh and his whole zemala.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

  <p>
    The column bivouacked at the foot of the mountain, where we had one
    whole day’s rest, while the provisions and ammunition intended for
    Milianah were being carried up into the town. It was the turn of our
    company to furnish outposts,—a service which recurred every sixth
    day, and I was sent with twelve others to the outermost line.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the foot of these mountains there is an abundance of water such as
    is rarely seen in Asia. Streams gushed out of the ravines and covered
    the surrounding country with the most luxuriant vegetation. There was
    an equal abundance of snakes, which we could well have spared. We
    had established ourselves behind a clump of wild olives to protect
    ourselves from the scorching rays of the sun, and I had formed a sort
    of small arbour and lain down under it to sleep, so as to be fresh
    for the night, when of course rest was out of the question. Scarce
    had I fallen asleep when I was roughly shaken and called by my name.
    I jumped up and seized my arms, thinking that at the very least
    Abd-el-Kader and his whole army were upon us, when my comrades showed
    me a huge snake coiled up behind my knapsack. It gazed enquiringly
    at us with its wise-looking eyes, and glided away into the bushes as
    soon as we attempted to seize it. We now held a council of war; for
    although the snake had as yet behaved with great propriety, we thought
    the presence of such guests during the night highly unwelcome. We
    accordingly resolved to set fire to the brushwood, and before long it
    was in a blaze. Presently our friend slipped out in haste and tried
    to take refuge in some bushes close by; but we fell upon it with
    sabres and muskets, and one of us at last succeeded in pinning it to
    the earth with his bayonet just behind the head. The creature hissed
    and lashed fiercely with its tail, but all in vain, its last hour was
    come. Its head was severed with a sabre from its body, which continued
    to move for several hours. When we left the spot in the morning the
    chief matador hung the snake round his neck as a trophy, and it was so
    long as nearly to touch the ground on both sides, so that it measured
    eight or nine feet at least.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had not marched far over some marshy ground covered with rushes
    and withered grass, when the battalions just before us separated as
    if by word of command, and another snake darted in long curves down
    the middle. We instantly made way for it to pass.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> The snake seemed
    in a great hurry and instantly disappeared among the rushes. One of
    the chief discomforts of Africa is the number of creeping things,
    poisonous as well as harmless, and of wild beasts. They are all,
    however, far less dangerous to man than is generally supposed. At any
    rate bodies of men have nothing to fear from them, as they invariably
    retreat before an advancing column. They only attack human beings when
    urged by the utmost necessity, either of self-defence or of hunger. I
    can only remember two instances of solitary sentinels being attacked
    and torn in pieces in the night by hyænas, which are indeed the most
    dangerous of all animals, as they kill for the mere pleasure of
    killing, and not from hunger. There is also a great plenty of lizards,
    scorpions, tarantulas, and all such vermin. The scorpions generally
    lurk under the small stones; and great care should always be taken in
    lying down to sleep, not to move them and thus disturb the scorpions,
    which might then crawl over one’s hands or face and sting them. Land
    tortoises abound in the marshy spots where the soldiers hunt for them
    during the march and eat them for supper. They afford an excellent
    soup and their flesh is as tender as chicken.
  </p>

  <p>
    We marched only about two leagues and then bivouacked on the further
    bank of the Schellif, in the very middle of a fine wheat field. The
    whole left bank, as far as the foot of the mountains, was covered with
    wheat and barley just ripe for the sickle.
  </p>

  <p>
    We saw nothing more of Abd-el-Kader, who had marched westward along
    the left bank of the Schellif the day before with all his cavalry.
    From our bivouac we could trace his route by the clouds of dust. He,
    probably, perceived that he had missed the favourable opportunity of
    attacking us.
  </p>

  <p>
    The column remained three days on the same spot, diligently employed
    in cutting as much corn as possible, and in conveying it to Milianah
    on every available horse, mule, and donkey in the camp. The harvest
    was so abundant as to supply the town for a whole year. On the fourth
    day we followed the course of the Schellif, burning the standing corn
    as we went. We did not, like Samson, set fire to the corn fields of
    the Philistines by driving into them three hundred foxes, with burning
    torches tied to their tails. We had the advantage of the experience
    of ages, and the noble inventions of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> times over the Israelite
    hero. Lucifer matches were distributed among the rear-guard, with
    which the crops were fired. We were once very near suffering from this
    proceeding. Some roving Arabs had thoughtlessly set fire to the corn
    on one side of the column: the wind blew from that quarter, and in
    a moment the whole column was enveloped in flames. Fearful disorder
    ensued, the terrified beasts of burden ran in all directions, and the
    smoke was so thick as to prevent our seeing the troops before us.
    A resolute enemy might at that moment have cut the whole column to
    pieces.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a march of two days we crossed back again to the right bank
    of the Schellif, over the only bridge we ever found in the interior
    of Africa. It had five arches, and appeared to be Roman, was built
    of hewn stone, and as perfect as if only finished yesterday. At the
    distance of one day’s march beyond this bridge the valley of the
    Schellif becomes exceedingly narrow; the river pent between high
    mountains, rushes like a torrent: ten or twelve leagues further the
    valley again widens into a plain.
  </p>

  <p>
    We bivouacked upon a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i> on the right bank of the river. The
    heights around us were covered with wild olives and dwarf oaks, and
    the valleys with the finest ripe corn. As the General had reason to
    suspect that we were near some rich Kabyle tribes, we remained on this
    spot for several days, during which the cavalry and some chosen bodies
    of infantry made excursions into the surrounding country every morning
    before dawn, and returned triumphant and loaded with booty every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    During all this time the number of sick increased fearfully: the
    forced marches, the excessive heat, and the quantity of meat which the
    soldiers ate without any other food but bad sea-biscuit, undermined
    their health. Diarrhœa and fever prevailed in every division.
    The mules were soon so loaded that many who could no longer drag
    themselves along were rejected and left to die on the road.
  </p>

  <p>
    The troops were so thoroughly disheartened that many of the soldiers
    destroyed themselves for fear of falling into the hands of the
    Bedouins. One of our battalion, who had been ill for some time,
    actually killed himself on a day of rest. On the pretext of cleaning
    his musket he went down to the river side and blew out his brains.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

  <p>
    From this point we turned back by the same route, across the bridge
    and along the left bank of the Schellif, and then following the foot
    of the mountains, we resumed our incendiary labours. This time,
    however, we were not left so entirely unmolested, for on the second
    day Abd-el-Kader’s horsemen galloped down from the mountains and
    attacked the right flank and the rear of the column with so much
    vigour, that the General was obliged to halt several times in order
    to send reinforcements to the rear-guard. Thus, with the thermometer
    at 100°, in a plain entirely bare of trees, the July sun darting its
    scorching rays full upon our heads, we had to return the incessant
    fire of the Bedouins, enveloped in the smoke and flames of the burning
    corn, and without a drop of water to quench our thirst! Truly, if
    purgatory be half so hot, one year’s penance would suffice to wipe out
    more sins than I have committed in all my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bedouins pursued us as far as the eastern boundary of the plain,
    where they left us by degrees. The number of the sick had increased
    so terribly that the General now resolved to send them to Blidah,
    and then to march with the rest of the column into the mountains of
    Cherchell. Among the sick was the Duke of Aumale, who had been carried
    in a litter for several days, and, indeed, this was probably the true
    reason for sending the sick to the hospital. General Bedeau, who had
    been made <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Maréchal-de-Camp</i> during this expedition, commanded the
    convoy of sick. The Duke of Aumale<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> succeeded General Bedeau in the
    command of the 17th light regiment, which had distinguished itself
    most honourably in every expedition.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this point the column marched to Medeah in one day, a distance of
    at least sixteen leagues. We stayed two days in that town to rest the
    weary soldiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our cavalry had the good fortune to surprise a hostile tribe concealed
    in a neighbouring valley, and to take a great number of cattle. On
    leaving Medeah we crossed the main ridge of the lesser Atlas to the
    westward of the Col de Mussaia, through some defiles which took the
    whole day to pass. We had not, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>ever, such a height to climb as
    at the Col. We followed the course of a mountain torrent which forms
    several considerable waterfalls. The heights on either side were
    covered with the finest pine and olive trees, and the whole scene was
    wildly beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    We reached the northern slope of the lesser Atlas on the second
    evening, and bivouacked in a small olive grove. Directly after
    midnight our cavalry started in deep silence, and the rest of the
    column followed before daybreak. We marched westward into the
    mountains, between Milianah and Cherchell, the abode of several
    considerable Kabyle tribes, among which the Beni-Manasser is the most
    powerful. We marched very rapidly, only halting ten or fifteen minutes
    at a time, till four o’clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, when we heard several
    shots just before us, which re-echoed a thousand times among the high
    mountains. As we concluded that our cavalry were already engaged with
    the hostile tribes, we hastened our march, and were soon met in a
    valley by a tribe of Kabyles,—men, women, and children, and countless
    herds of cattle, flying before our cavalry. After a short resistance,
    most of the men able to bear arms,—some on horseback, and some on
    foot,—fled in all directions, and hid themselves in the mountains.
    The old men, women and children, and twelve or fifteen thousand head
    of beasts, consisting of sheep, goats, two thousand cows, and a few
    camels, fell into our hands. Many of the goats had four horns.
  </p>

  <p>
    As our bivouac was not far from some Kabyle villages, we of course
    went to look at them. They lay almost hidden at the foot of the
    mountains, and high hedges of prickly pear surrounded and nearly
    concealed from sight the low huts built of rough stone, and covered
    with a flat roof of rushes. Most of these hovels had already been set
    on fire by our cavalry. Some of the soldiers searched the burning huts
    at the peril of their lives, but found nothing save a few sheep skins,
    a pot of honey, and some cats, who seemed unwilling to leave their
    homes.
  </p>

  <p>
    We made a sortie on each of the two following days, but came too late
    on both. The tribes were informed of what had happened, and we found
    nothing but their empty huts.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

  <p>
    The prisoners, chiefly old men, women and children, were driven with
    the cattle, under a special guard, in the middle of the column; it
    was heart-rending to see women and children, unaccustomed to walking
    and barefooted, compelled to follow the rapid march of the column,
    over rocks and briars. Their feet were soon torn and bleeding, and
    they dragged themselves along with the greatest difficulty. They
    seldom made any complaint: only when one of their number dropped from
    fatigue, and was left behind, they all uttered a loud wail.
  </p>

  <p>
    We now left the mountain and turned back towards the plains of the
    Metidja, where we encountered all the horrors of an African summer.
    Every trace of vegetation had disappeared; the burning sun had so
    parched the soil that it was full of clefts large enough for a man to
    hide in. The dark green of the few scattered olive trees was changed
    to a dirty yellow; in short, a northern winter with its snowy mantle,
    is a cheering sight when compared to the desert and melancholy aspect
    of an African summer.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the summer months the nights are as cold as the days are hot;
    the change of temperature is felt at sunset, and towards daybreak a
    heavy dew falls, as penetrating as rain, and very dangerous to the
    health; it frequently produces diseases of the eyes which end in
    blindness. The natives invariably draw their bernouses over their
    heads at night to protect them from the bad effects of the dew; we
    have adopted this custom, and the soldiers seldom lie down at night
    without a cap or a handkerchief over their faces.
  </p>

  <p>
    We marched towards Blidah across the plain at the foot of the Sahel
    mountains. This ridge of the chain is low at this point; it is highest
    near Algiers. It contains most beautiful and fruitful vales, in which
    are forsaken gardens and villas which once belonged to the Moors. The
    heights are covered with dwarf oaks and other shrubs which shelter
    numbers of wild boars, smaller and less fierce than those of Europe:
    the soldiers often kill them with their bayonets. The natives assert
    that the Spaniards brought these unclean animals into the country out
    of spite. As swine are an abomination to the Mahomedan, and may not
    be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> eaten, the breed increases rapidly. The strongest expression of
    contempt that an Arab can use to an European is “Haluf,” (swine).
  </p>

  <p>
    At about three leagues from Coleah, on some high table land in the
    Sahel mountains, stands a gigantic African monument, which both the
    Arab and the French call the Queen’s Tomb. It is in the form of a
    marabout, built of rough stone, and has every appearance of great
    antiquity. The natives attach the following legend to it. Once upon
    a time a Spanish Queen landed on this coast with an army of fifty
    thousand men, in order to conquer the country; but even at her landing
    an evil omen foretold her failure: as she left her vessel the crown
    fell from her head into the sea, and could never be found again.
    A great battle was fought on the very spot where the marabout now
    stands, the Queen was beaten and destroyed with her whole army, and
    the tomb was raised by the Arabs as a memorial of their victory. The
    Arabs still seek the lost crown on this coast, and it is said that
    from time to time pearls of prodigious size and beauty are found upon
    the beach. Some of the better informed among the Arabs have told me
    that the monument contains graves of the Numidian Kings, which seems
    rather more probable: at any rate it is of high antiquity. Nor do I
    remember to have read of any Spanish or other Queen who ever invaded
    this country.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not very far from Blidah, we came upon several French regiments of
    the line bivouacking on the plain, and at work upon a ditch and
    breastwork which the Governor had commanded to be thrown up the whole
    way from the sea to Blidah,—a distance of ten leagues,—in order to
    protect the Metidja from the attacks of the Bedouins. The ditch is
    about ten feet deep by twenty wide, with a breastwork in proportion,
    strengthened with palisades; small blockhouses are built at intervals
    of a thousand paces to command the ditch.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work will very much impede, if it does not totally prevent, the
    nocturnal forays of the Bedouins; it will, at any rate, put a stop
    to their coming on horseback, and in great troops. If a few should
    even steal in on foot between the blockhouses, they would not be able
    to drive away their prey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> such as cattle, &amp;c., which is their chief
    object. The completion of this eighth wonder of the world is much to
    be desired, for the protection of the lives and properties of the
    unfortunate colonists in the plain, and as an inducement to others to
    settle there, for colonisation has made very little progress hitherto.
    Buffarik, a small village chiefly inhabited by Germans, is the only
    colony in the plain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coleah, Duera, and Delhi Ibrahim are the only colonies of any
    importance in the Sahel, and even there the whole colonisation
    consists of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafés</i>, canteens, and a few kitchen gardens.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Coleah they have begun to form a colony of old worn out soldiers,
    but I have great doubts of its success. These veterans, it is true,
    have the double advantage of being tolerably well used to the climate
    and of knowing how to conduct themselves with prudence and coolness
    when attacked by the enemy; on the other hand, an old soldier
    generally makes a very bad peasant, and is ten times more patient of
    the dangers and hardships of war than of daily work with spade and
    plough. He usually takes unto himself some profligate woman not at all
    likely to attach him to his home, and then of course, neglects his
    farm, and soon dissipates the small sum allowed him by the Government,
    and the end of it all is, that he sells his oxen and his plough, turns
    off his female companion and enlists for a few years more. And now
    the old fellow who used to curse the service heartily, finds it quite
    a decent and comfortable way of life, and it is amusing to hear with
    what indignation he speaks of the life of a colonist.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only means of establishing a permanent colony in Africa would be
    for the French Government to send over, at some expense it is true,
    a number of real agricultural families from the north of France, or,
    better still, from Germany. The southern Frenchmen are totally unfit
    for colonists. The only kind of agriculture which they would be able
    to pursue with any profit is the cultivation of the grape, and this is
    strictly prohibited, for fear of injuring the mother country. Hitherto
    the Government never seems to have been really in earnest about the
    colonisation of Africa.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

  <p>
    The column returned to Algiers through Blidah, Buffarik, and Duera.
    From Algiers we are to be distributed into summer quarters: winter
    quarters do not exist here. One battalion is to be sent, for the
    present, to Mustapha Superieur, the depôt of the Foreign Legion; and
    we shall soon go to Coleah, a town in the Sahel mountains, in a most
    healthy situation, to recruit after our fatigues and losses.

  </div>

  <p class="rightinset">Algiers, September, 1841.</p>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Our</span> regiment has lain eight days under the walls of Algiers, between
    the Casabah and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fort l’Empereur</i>, on the very highest point of the
    whole town. Some wooden sheds have been assigned to us as quarters.
  </p>

  <p>
    We marched hither from Coleah in two days without great exertion: and
    are in daily expectation of embarking to join the column at Mostaganem.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few days ago our regiment was inspected by the Military Intendant
    and the Inspector-General, whose duty it is to examine the state
    of the troops every three months: but as we have been constantly
    in active service, this is the first time since I have joined the
    Legion that a review has taken place. These officers are supposed
    to assure themselves that the troops and materials of war are in
    efficient condition, and to see that the men have everything to which
    they are entitled. The whole affair is however a mere formality.
    The two gentlemen walk through the ranks, look at the reports, and
    ask here and there a soldier whether he has any complaints to make:
    after which they get into their carriage, complimenting the Commander
    in the most flattering terms, on the admirable condition of his
    regiment. Reclamations made by the soldiers are satisfied in the
    most summary manner by arrest for groundless complaints. There is
    unfortunately often cause enough for complaint in all the regiments,
    but the means of appeal are so complicated that a soldier has the
    greatest difficulty in making his grievance known. Any commissioned
    or non-commissioned officer who ventured to assist him would never be
    forgiven, and must give up all hopes of advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>ment as long as he
    lives. Nothing is so odious to the French as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reclameur</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not think that the Military Intendants answer the purpose for
    which they were intended,—that of preventing abuses. If the soldiers
    have no confidence in their superior officers, they will have still
    less in these Intendants, who are not at all more infallible, and who
    in case of any abuse only go shares with the former. At all events the
    Intendants are universally hated by the soldiers. They are generally
    sent here by favour and protection, to recruit their broken fortunes;
    as the Roman Prætors and Proconsuls were sent into the conquered
    provinces. They know nothing of the soldiers, and care nothing about
    them. That their office is a very lucrative one, is sufficiently
    proved by the luxurious lives which most of them lead. A harem of
    women of all nations, balls and dinners, compensate these gentlemen
    for the want of the Parisian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I walked to the great hospital called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’Hôpital du Dey</i> to visit a
    sick friend. This building stands on the western side of the city, in
    the gardens formerly belonging to the Dey, and its position on the
    slope of the Sahel, open to the refreshing sea breeze, is equally
    healthy and delightful. The Dey’s palace is converted into apartments
    for sick officers, and for those connected with the administration
    of the hospital, while as many as fifty or sixty wooden sheds have
    been erected in the vast garden, and constitute the actual hospital.
    These are capable of containing eight thousand men, and yet they are
    sometimes insufficient for the number of sick who pour in from all
    sides. They are well built and provided with beds, but not solid
    enough to keep out the heat of summer. The treatment and care of the
    patients are not bad for Africa. The soldiers, indeed, complain that
    they are starved, and that all their diseases are doctored with rice
    water and tisane; but these are good remedies for diarrhœa and fevers,
    which are the prevailing disorders. Besides, discontent is one of the
    characteristics of the soldier. At any rate, the hospitals are much
    improved since Bugeaud’s arrival. In several places they have begun
    to build strong massive hospitals, to replace the wooden sheds; and
    the frequent personal visits of the Governor have done much towards
    abolishing the prevailing abuses and the rough treatment of the
    surgeons.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

  <p>
    With considerable difficulty I found my friend, who was already
    convalescent; as he was just starting for a walk along the winding
    paths of the garden, I accompanied him. Everything had been done
    here to satisfy the southern longing after shade and water. Earthen
    pipes conveyed the freshest water the whole way from the mountains
    to various parts of the garden in which it gushed forth, and thick
    winding alleys of magnificent orange and almond trees afforded the
    most refreshing shade. All the sick who were able to leave their beds
    were assembled in these shady walks enjoying the cool sea breeze; this
    host of ghostlike beings crawling slowly along in their grey capotes
    and white night-caps had a most singular appearance; their glazed eyes
    looked sadly out of their sallow emaciated faces, all of which bore
    traces of misery, and most of melancholy and home-sickness.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was easy to guess the character and station of the invalids from
    the nature of their conversation or amusements. Some lay on the ground
    playing at cards or with dice: these were old veterans who had long
    given up all idea of a peaceable domestic life, and whose only object
    was to kill time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Others walked up and down relating their exploits and occasionally
    criticizing their generals and officers;—these still had a remnant of
    enthusiasm for their calling. Others again sat on the benches around
    with drooping heads, and talked of their homes and of the mistresses
    they had left behind. Several times I heard the mournful exclamation,
    “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma belle France!</i>” Poor devils! many of them will never see fair
    France again.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took leave of my friend with a melancholy feeling, methought I had,
    like Odysseus, gone down living into the world of shadows.

  <p class="rightinset">Mostaganem, October, 1841.</p>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">On</span> the 4th instant our battalion went on board a brig-of-war, of
    fourteen guns, which was to take us from Algiers to Mostaganem. We
    sailed under the most favourable auspices: a gentle easterly breeze
    filled our sails and we soon lost sight of Algiers. At noon we passed
    La Torre Chica where the French landed in 1830, and from whence they
    marched upon Algiers. It is the best landing-place on the whole coast.
    Towards evening when we were nearly opposite Cherchell the wind fell
    and was succeeded by a dead calm which lasted all night. The night was
    such as can only be seen and felt on the Mediterranean: the air was so
    warm that I could not endure the heat between decks, and accordingly
    brought up my blanket and lay down upon deck. The sky was deep blue
    and the stars seemed larger and nearer to me than I had ever seen them
    before. The ship floated like a nutshell on the boundless and glassy
    surface of the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ominous calm was followed by a fearful storm. The day broke
    with the most threatening appearances: the sun rose blood-red and
    evidently with no good intentions. Numbers of sea fowl gathered
    round the ship screeching with hunger; a quantity of small fish
    sprang terror-stricken out of the water, in which they were pursued
    by the larger ones; and on reaching the surface they were instantly
    devoured by the gulls: for even the brute creation acknowledges but
    one right—that of the strongest. In the distance we saw a shoal of
    porpoises tumbling head over heels towards the south-west. These signs
    made the old sailors shake their heads and prophecy a bad night;—nor
    were they deceived.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> Towards evening we saw the sea heaving from the
    south-west, as if urged by some unknown power. The Captain ordered the
    sails to be shortened, and at the shrill whistle of the boatswain some
    twenty sailors ran up the rigging. The top-sails were scarce reefed
    before the storm was upon us. The ship reeled so much under the shock
    of the gale that our masts nearly touched the water: a loud crack was
    suddenly heard, and one of the sails flew like a seagull through the
    air; the bolt-ropes had given way. The good ship now righted. In a
    moment all but a try-sail was made snug, and the head of the vessel
    was turned to meet the blast.
  </p>

  <p>
    We retreated before the beating waves, but only step by step, like a
    brave warrior. By this time night had closed in with a sky as dark and
    dreary as old chaos; the sea alone was bright and clear, as if the
    better to show its yawning depths. At one moment the ship hovered on
    the top of a towering wave, and at the next she plunged so deep that
    the first rolling wave threatened to swallow us up.
  </p>

  <p>
    I leaned against the mast, holding by a rope for fear of being washed
    overboard, entranced by the sight of the raging sea, and astonished
    at its beauty. Beautiful as is the sea in repose, it is far more
    beautiful in anger. The calm fills us with dreary melancholy, while
    the storm inspires us with the full feeling of our own power and
    activity. In such moments as these I never think of danger.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the following morning we saw the Balearic Isles just behind us, and
    were losing ground. The dark olive woods of the island of Majorca rose
    higher and higher out of the sea, and we had the agreeable prospect of
    becoming very closely acquainted with the jagged rocky shore of the
    island, and of trying the hardness of our skulls against that of its
    stones.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most fortunately the storm somewhat abated, and the wind veered round
    to the northward, so that we could set a few of our sails and steer
    our old course towards Mostaganem.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although the north wind favoured us, we made very little way that day,
    as the sea ran very high from the south-west and the ship laboured
    violently and was tossed like a ball on the ocean. During the night
    the sea went down a little, and we continued our course with a
    moderate north-wind.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

  <p>
    One of our battalion died this morning: the body was lashed upon a
    board and lowered into the sea without further ceremony.
    “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vois tu, Pierre, comme il nous regarde</i>,”
    said an old sailor to one of his
    messmates, pointing to the already distant corpse. “To be sure,”
    answered the other “they all do so as long as the ship is in sight.”
    I looked after him, and true enough, each time the dead man rose and
    sunk with the waves, he turned his pale face towards the vessel. No
    class of men are more superstitious than sailors, unless indeed it be
    soldiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Towards evening we saw the coast of Mostaganem, and on the top of
    a high rock the town with its fort and surrounding blockhouses.
    Mostaganem has no proper harbour, only a roadstead which cannot be
    used except in calm weather. It was night when we cast anchor, and as
    the sea was then smooth and might possibly become rough, the captain
    sent us ashore in his boats. As he was assisted in this operation by
    several larger boats which came from the shore, the battalion was soon
    landed. It was too late to march up to the town, so we took up our
    well-known quarters in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Hôtel à la Belle Etoile</i>. Our bed was soon
    made; every one wrapped himself as well as he could in his blanket,
    laid his head on his knapsack, and was soon lulled to sleep by the
    regular murmur of the waves.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a short time I woke again; the deepest silence reigned around me,
    and the stars looked down upon me as bright and calm and cheerful as
    if they had never known grief, nor troubled themselves in the least
    about the miseries of the unfortunate dwellers upon earth. The solemn
    silence of nature was only broken by the chafing of the waves against
    the rocks. I lay and watched wave after wave break at my feet, till
    I gradually sunk into a most pleasing reverie. In spite of all the
    hardships and distresses it has inflicted upon me,—in spite of sea
    biscuit and sea sickness, I still love the sea. When a boy, my secret
    and favourite scheme was to build me a castle on the sea shore,
    therein to end my days, and at last to die like the king of Thule:
  </p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That was indeed a jovial and glorious death! I could not wish a better.</p>

  <p>
    After daybreak we marched to Mostaganem, which stands half a league
    from the sea, and took up our quarters in some wooden sheds under the
    walls of Matamor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Matamor is a small Moorish fort built on a rock commanding the town.
    Here the Spaniards formerly won a great victory over the Moors, and
    thence the name Matamoros (kill the Moors).
  </p>

  <p>
    Mostaganem is separated from this fort by a considerable brook, which
    rises at about two leagues up the mountain. The town is accessible
    only from the south, by one solitary gate; on every other side
    it is surrounded by a deep ravine at the bottom of which roars a
    mountain torrent, or by lofty and precipitous walls of rock. It would
    therefore seem easy enough to defend Mostaganem against any attack,
    but unfortunately Fort Matamor, which should protect the town, itself
    needs protection, as it is commanded by a neighbouring height, and its
    walls are not of sufficient strength to resist heavy ordnance; and
    thus it was that the French obtained possession first of the fort and
    subsequently of the town.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mostaganem contains four or five thousand inhabitants, Arabs,
    Spaniards and Jews, besides the French regiment in garrison. The town
    must formerly have been much larger, as is shown by the number of
    ruins scattered without the walls; but, with the exception of a few
    mosques, there is no building of any importance. The former citadel,
    the Casabah, is in ruins, and is only garrisoned by some fifty or
    sixty pairs of storks who have founded a colony on the extensive walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    Almost as much Spanish is spoken here as French or Arabic. Nearly
    all the natives speak a corrupt Spanish, a kind of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lingua franca</i>,
    which prevails in all the towns on the coast of Africa. The younger
    generation, however,—boys from 10 to 14—speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> French with tolerable
    fluency, but somewhat marred by their deep guttural tone. The ease
    with which Arabs and Bedouins continue to imitate whatever they have
    but once seen or heard is very remarkable. Nature seems to have
    bestowed this gift of imitation on half-savage nations to compensate
    them for the want of original invention.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

  <p>
    The General lives in the town, where some of the best houses have been
    arranged for him and his staff; the troops are quartered in wooden
    sheds, partly in the town and partly under the walls of Matamor.
    These sheds would hold as many as fifteen thousand men, but the
    actual number is nine thousand, including the allied cavalry, which
    is composed of from two to three thousand Arabs and Bedouins under
    the command of a native leader, called the Bey of Mostaganem. He is
    a fine handsome man of about forty, and was formerly a friend and
    devoted adherent of Abd-el-Kader, in which capacity he gave the French
    much trouble. He once proposed to Abd-el-Kader to make an attempt
    to recover his lost town of Mascara which the French had taken and
    then left, ill provisioned and worse garrisoned: the Emir did not
    enter into the scheme with sufficient alacrity to please the Bey who
    denounced Abd-el-Kader as a coward, and threatened to desert him and
    to join the French. This was no sooner said than done. He and his two
    or three thousand horsemen went over to the French, and he has been
    their most faithful ally ever since. The General treats him with the
    greatest distinction, and his own people reverence him as a prince.
    He never goes out without a considerable suite; on his left rides a
    marabout, and on his right the officer whose duty is to shelter him
    from the sun with a huge yellow umbrella; he is preceded by musicians
    beating the tam tam, a large drum, accompanied by pipes and cymbals.
    They always play the same tune, which seems to be a triumphal march,
    discordant enough to European ears, but delightful to Arab ones. The
    moment the tam tam sounds, the Arabs rock themselves to and fro in
    their saddles with pleasure; and I must confess, that diabolical as I
    thought this music at first, I grew fond of it in time, and something
    seemed wanting to me if the Arab march was not played on entering or
    leaving the bivouac; so true is it that old familiar tunes affect us
    most powerfully. Most likely it is less the music itself than the
    crowd of images and recollections which it awakens in our minds that
    exercises such magic power over us. For this reason every regiment
    should have a march of its own, to be played on particular occasions,
    as is the case with most regiments here. When the well-known tones of
    the regimental march strike upon the ear of the weary and exhausted
    men, the effect is magical: their wan faces brighten up, their muscles
    acquire fresh strength, and they march forwards with renewed vigour,
    perhaps even humming a song.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is said that the French Government pays the Bey as much as forty
    thousand francs a year for his services. Each Arab soldier receives a
    franc a day, out of which he has to maintain himself and his horse;
    besides this pay he has his share of the razzia money. The booty made
    on these expeditions is distributed, or should be so legally, among
    the officers and soldiers according to their rank; but the common
    soldiers complain, and perhaps not quite without reason, that the
    higher powers are apt to keep the lion’s share for themselves. The
    Bey and the superior officers lodge in the town; the rest of the Arab
    cavalry is encamped without the walls on the southern side of the
    brook. Each soldier has his own tent, where his wife or wives manage
    his household; his horse stands picketed and usually ready saddled at
    his door, both summer and winter. A few minutes suffice to prepare
    this body of cavalry for action. At the sight of the colours flying on
    the top of the mosque, and at the sound of the tam tam, the Arabs jump
    on their horses and follow their leader. A few days ago a report was
    suddenly spread that Abd-el-Kader had seized our cattle at pasture in
    a valley about a league hence; the general march was beat, the colours
    were hoisted on the top of the mosque, and the warlike tam tam was
    sounded. In one moment all were under arms, and each division marched
    as it was ready: the Arabs started off singly and galloped to the
    scene of action, spurring their bleeding horses to their utmost speed;
    they swung their long rifles round their heads as if they had been
    javelins, crying aloud, “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Phantasia! Phantasia!</i>” in their joy and
    eagerness for battle. It is not possible to conceive a wilder or more
    beautiful picture of war. Before we could reach the spot, panting and
    heated from running, the action was over. Our herds and their guards
    had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> been attacked by a few bold robbers belonging to a neighbouring
    tribe, who had fled at the approach of our Arab cavalry: a chase
    ensued, but without success, for the robbers were as well mounted as
    their pursuers, and had a considerable start and no inconsiderable
    fear in their favour.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of our Arab horsemen are mounted on Bedouin horses, which are a
    neglected variety of the Barbary breed; they are small and lean, but
    of wonderful speed and endurance: with very short intervals of rest
    they can keep up a sort of long gallop up and down hill, over any sort
    of broken ground for the whole day, and they are as sure-footed as
    goats.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Arabs ride with matchless boldness down the precipitous and broken
    sides of the mountains. Often, when we have been pursued by the enemy
    and left them as we thought on the very top of the mountain, in a few
    minutes we have been astonished by their bullets whistling about our
    ears.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides the Bey’s horsemen, several considerable tribes of Arabs and
    Bedouins near Mostaganem and Oran have submitted to the French, and
    come daily to the town with their camels and horses to bring fruit,
    corn, vegetables, cattle, &amp;c., to market. They cannot fail to discover
    in time that they derive the most solid advantages from the French
    dominion, under which their lives and properties are far more secure
    than they ever were before, and their produce is trebled in value.
    The latter circumstance they are especially able to appreciate, for,
    barbarians as they are, they well know the value of money; indeed, I
    never saw men so rapacious as the Bedouins; perhaps their avarice is
    called forth by the contact with Europeans.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is highly entertaining to see the soldiers haggling with the
    Bedouins for fruit, eggs, &amp;c. The soldier comes with the full
    intention of overreaching the Bedouin (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lui tirer une carotte</i>), and
    of robbing him by force or fraud, of a fowl or of some eggs, for in
    Africa everything is a lawful prize. The Bedouin, on the other hand,
    who most likely has been cheated two or three times before, stands
    resolutely on the defensive and never parts with anything until the
    money is paid into his hand. This provokes abuse, in which, however,
    the Bedouin far excels even the Frenchman, and blows not unfrequently
    follow; but the Bedouin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> would rather lose his life than the smallest
    fraction of his property, and the fight continues till a
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sergent de police</i> comes up and puts an end to it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hundreds of Bedouins mounted on camels and horses, and the
    quantity of Arab cavalry interspersed with soldiers in various
    uniforms, give a very peculiar air to Mostaganem. It is a perfect
    picture of a camp, where in spite of want, misery, and of danger past,
    present, and future, the childish, careless joyousness of the soldiers
    is everywhere apparent.
  </p>

  <p>
    About a league from here is Fort Massagran, famous for the heroic
    defence by Captain Lièvre. I have heard an account of this whole
    affair from eye-witnesses, and am fully persuaded that the defence
    was one of the most gallant actions of the whole war, although it was
    somewhat exaggerated by the French newspapers. The fort, the walls of
    which are tolerably high and strong, stands on a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i> which falls
    precipitously on the northern side, rendering the fort inaccessible in
    that quarter. The village of Massagran lies somewhat lower down and
    could only be defended indirectly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Captain Lièvre had under him a hundred and fifty <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">disciplinaires</i>
    and a few cannon, while for several days in succession the fort was
    assailed by a host of six or eight thousand Bedouins, on foot and on
    horseback, who made several attempts to carry the place by storm. All
    their attacks were repulsed with the most determined coolness, until
    at length the fort was relieved by troops sent from Mostaganem. It
    is true that the garrison had the advantage of high walls and some
    artillery, but any one who knows how powerfully so overwhelming a mass
    of assailants affects men’s minds, can estimate the extraordinary
    experience and intrepidity required in order to retain thorough
    self-possession. The whole company of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">disciplinaires</i> who had formed
    the garrison, were immediately reinstated among the regiments of the
    line, and each soldier received a medal struck for the occasion.
    Captain Lièvre was made a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Commandant</i> and received the cross of the
    Legion of Honour.
  </p>

  <p>
    Commandant Lièvre has the reputation of a brave and distinguished
    officer; he commanded a battalion of the fifty-third regiment, (if I
    am not mistaken,) which formed part of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">colonne mobile</i>, and of
    almost every expedition up to July 1842.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Mostaganem and Oran have been for centuries the ports to which all
    the caravans from the interior of Africa have come to exchange
    their produce with that of the north. The towns of Mascara and
    Tlemsen, which are but a few days’ march from hence, served them as
    resting-places and warehouses; and they have lost the source of their
    wealth and importance since the French occupation has driven the
    caravan trade to Morocco.
  </p>

  <p>
    The district south of Mostaganem may be called the home of the
    Bedouins, if indeed these wanderers have a home. There the richest and
    most powerful tribes fix their tents, sow and reap their corn, and
    feed their flocks, purposes for which the country is well adapted. The
    large plains between Mostaganem, Mascara, and Oran, and the fertile
    valleys of the Schellif and the Mina, afford these nomades excellent
    pasture for their numerous herds, and an unlimited run for their
    horses and camels. During the whole winter, and till the month of
    June, which is their harvest time, the Bedouins camp in these places;
    but when the heat has burnt up whatever pasture was left, they retreat
    into the valleys and defiles of the Atlas, where food of some sort,
    though scanty, is still to be found for their flocks and herds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of the tribes near Mostaganem and Oran have submitted to the
    French; thanks to the zeal and activity of General Lamoricière, the
    Governor of the province of Oran. They prefer paying a moderate
    tribute and feeding their herds in peace, to seeing their property,
    their wives and their children continually exposed to the unexpected
    attack of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">colonne mobile</i>.
  </p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="rightinset">Middle of October.</p>

  <p>
    Nature is just beginning to shake off the lethargy produced by the
    deadly, parching heat of summer. A few rainy days are sufficient
    to call into existence, as it were by magic, the most luxuriant
    vegetation: the richest verdure has sprung up beneath the withered
    grass, the leaves of the trees have lost their sickly yellow hue, the
    buds have begun to burst, and the birds to sing their spring songs. In
    short, this is the African spring, but I must assert my preference for
    the real spring in Germany.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

  <p>
    The revival of nature in the north is more powerful and all-pervading,
    though not so sudden. In a northern climate every creature greets
    with a more heartfelt gratitude the glorious freshness and beauty of
    the woods and fields when their icy winter clothing has been stripped
    off by the returning sun. A more joyful thrill runs through us when
    the first lark rises towards heaven, pouring out its shrill hymn of
    praise, and the confiding swallow builds her nest under the eaves
    of our houses. It is far different here: it is true the song of the
    birds still pleases me, and the green carpet of nature is refreshing
    to my eyes. But not as in Europe. It may be, indeed, that the change
    does not lie in nature but in myself: the experience of a few hard
    years has, perhaps, blunted my feelings, and made me less capable of
    enjoying her beauties.
  </p>

  <p>
    The burst of vegetation was strongest in the valley which divides the
    fort from the town, and which is watered by a stream. Every inch of
    ground there is turned to the profit of man: magnificent fruit trees,
    pomegranates, figs, and oranges, and the most various vegetables cover
    the ground, and Spaniards, Arabs, Jews, and Frenchmen are diligently
    employed in cultivating the fruitful soil. The soldier alone thinks
    this manual labour beneath his dignity, and lies at full length under
    a shady fig tree smoking a cigar and drinking his last sou’s-worth
    of Spanish wine. Others are washing their shirts and gaiters at the
    brook: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mort de ma vie</i>,” cries one; “How much better my Suzette
    would wash these shirts!” Another bitterly regrets the three sous he
    has expended in soap, which might have been so much better laid out
    on a pint of Spanish wine. These sallies produce general and joyous
    laughter. Poor fellows! these few days of rest and relaxation can
    scarce be grudged them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cavalry of the Bey, who lie at a little distance in strange,
    picturesque groups, form a remarkable contrast to the active, restless
    European soldiers. The Arab lies whole days before his tent, wrapped
    in his bernouse and leaning his head on his hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> His horse stands
    ready saddled, listlessly hanging his head almost to the ground, and
    occasionally casting sympathising glances on his master. The African
    might then be supposed phlegmatic and passionless, but for the
    occasional flash of his wild dark eye, which gleams from under his
    bushy brows. His rest is like that of the Numidian lion which, when
    satisfied, stretches itself beneath a shady palm tree,—but beware of
    waking him. Like the beasts of the desert and forest, and like all
    nature in his own land, the Arab is hurried from one extreme to the
    other,—from the deepest repose to the most restless activity. At the
    first sound of the tam tam his foot is in the stirrup, his hand on his
    rifle, and he is no longer the same man. He rides day and night, bears
    every privation, and braves every danger, in order to make a prize of
    some sheep, or ass, or of some enemy’s head. Such men as these are
    hard to conquer, and harder still to govern: were they united into
    one people, they would form a nation which could not only repulse the
    French but bid defiance to the whole world. Unhappily for them every
    tribe is at enmity with the rest; and this must ultimately lead to
    their destruction, for the French have already learnt to match African
    against African.

    <span class="smcap">The</span> brig Loiret had lain off Arzew for five months: I was serving on
    board this vessel commanded by Lieutenant Roland de Chabert. It is
    easy to conceive the dulness of our life on a desert coast devoid
    of all interest or amusement. Our only pleasure was a walk upon the
    beach, and even that was necessarily confined within the outposts,
    as the Arabs were incessantly lurking about the few houses which the
    French have built at Arzew, watching for an opportunity to carry off
    the cattle. They had already tried more than one <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>, but
    hitherto had always been repulsed with loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 11th of August, 1836, we received orders to be ready next day,
    with forty of our crew, to reconnoitre a well about two leagues beyond
    our outposts, accompanied by part of the garrison. I was one of those
    selected to form part of the expedition, and went to bed at midnight,
    after my watch, overjoyed at the thoughts of next day’s excursion up
    the country.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 12th, at four in the morning, M. Roland de Chabert, the
    Commander of the Loiret, Dr. Clinchard, M. Bravois, and myself,
    with forty of our crew, all armed, went on shore, and found Captain
    Reveroni, the Commandant of the place, who informed us, that General
    Létang had given orders to suspend the expedition till he could send
    us reinforcements.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we had made all the necessary arrangements on board for our
    campaign, which we expected would occupy the whole day, we determined
    to turn our freedom to account.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

  <p>
    The Commander and the officers of the Loiret proposed to go and pick
    up the balls, which our gunners had fired in yesterday’s practice.
    We consulted the Commandant as to the feasibility of our scheme, and
    the danger we might incur in going beyond the outposts. M. Reveroni
    approved very much of our resolution, and assured us that there would
    be no danger in passing the outposts, provided we did not go too
    far. We accordingly took leave of M. Reveroni, and advanced into the
    plain: at about a hundred yards beyond the outposts we halted, and
    stationed some of our men on a height to give the alarm in case we
    were surprised by the Arabs. Having taken this precaution, we began
    to seek for our balls, and to measure the range of our guns; I was
    thus occupied, at a distance of about two musket-shots from the rest
    of the troop with the Commander, Dr. Clinchard, and two sailors, when
    suddenly I espied a partridge close at hand, and after pointing it out
    to Dr. Clinchard, I ran after it, taking aim.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had gone only a few steps, when a troop of Arabs suddenly poured out
    of a ravine, came down upon us at full gallop and surrounded us on all
    sides. They advanced towards me, crying, “<i>Semi! Semi!</i>” (Friends!
    Friends!) Deceived by these exclamations, I turned to explain them
    to the Doctor, when one of the Arabs snatched at the musket which I
    held in my hand; this showed me their real intentions, and I instantly
    fired at the Arab who had tried to seize the musket, and broke his
    shoulder. He dropped his gun, which was loaded, and was forced to
    throw his arm round the neck of his horse to prevent falling off. I
    darted at the gun, but two Arabs took aim at my head, and as I turned
    away to avoid their fire, one ball gave me a slight wound on the head,
    and the other passed through my shirt and grazed my breast.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had not lost sight of the wounded Arab’s gun, and stooped again to
    pick it up, when something rough slipped over my face; I raised my
    hands to it, and felt a rope round my neck; at the same moment, a
    violent jerk brought me to the ground, and an Arab, who had the other
    end of the rope fastened to his saddle-bow, set off at full gallop.
  </p>

  <p>
    My cries and entreaties were all in vain, the Arab spurred on his
    horse, and I was dragged half strangled through rocks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> briars.
    This horrible torture lasted some minutes, until the horse was forced
    by steep and stony ground to slacken his pace, when I got on my feet
    again. In spite of the wounds with which my face, hands, and legs
    were covered, and the stunning effects of such a shock, I still had
    strength to seize the cord so as to keep myself from being strangled,
    and to run forward and catch hold of the horse’s tail.
  </p>

  <p>
    But as soon as the other Arabs, who had been dispersed by the sailors
    sent to our assistance, rejoined their companions, I was loaded with
    abuse and stripped nearly naked. Our misfortune had been seen from the
    brig, which immediately fired upon the Arabs: but every shot cost me a
    fresh shower of blows, and the horse to which I was tied took fright
    at the noise and started forward, and I again fell to the ground;
    the Arabs ran after me beating me all the time, and if by chance I
    succeeded in getting on my feet, my pitiless persecutor set off again
    at a gallop, casting looks of contempt upon me.
  </p>

  <p>
    The incessant galloping of the horse and the violent jerks of the cord
    which dragged and rolled me among the rocks and briars, leaving a
    track of blood behind me—the abuse and the blows of the Arabs, lasted
    a quarter of an hour: this sounds but a short time, but it seemed very
    long to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    As soon as the Arabs thought themselves out of reach of pursuit, they
    halted in order to cut off my head. The rope was taken off my neck, my
    hands bound behind my back, and I was tied to a dwarf palm tree. I was
    so tired, that I lay down upon the ground perfectly indifferent to the
    fate which I knew awaited all prisoners taken by the Arabs. I had but
    one sad thought, of my family and my poor sister, but this was soon
    driven away by the near approach of death and the animated scene in
    which I, though chained and silent, was the principal person.
  </p>

  <p>
    A violent discussion had arisen among the Arabs: they brandished their
    sabres over my head, and each claimed the pleasure of cutting it off,
    all crying at once, “I took him, I have a right to cut off his head;”
    and each to prove the truth of his assertion showed a fragment of my
    shirt or of my coat. The Arabs were already taking aim at one another,
    and exclaiming, “I ought to cut off his head, and I will kill you
    if you don’t let me enjoy my rights,” when a horseman galloped up
    and threw into my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> lap the head of Jonquié, one of the sailors; as
    I turned away in disgust at this horrible spectacle, I saw the Arab
    whom I had wounded lying on the ground about fifty paces off. He could
    scarcely support himself, and was endeavouring to aim at me with a
    pistol which he held in his left hand. But horsemen were every instant
    passing to and fro before him, and he dropped his hand, patiently
    awaiting the favorable moment to fire.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was expecting the end of this horrible discussion with some
    impatience, when the arrival of another horseman changed the
    determination of the Arabs. This was Adda, a spy of Abd-el-Kader,
    who had often visited us at Arzew, where he feigned an intention of
    establishing himself, and allayed any suspicion we might entertain
    of him by assuring us that his frequent visits were for the purpose
    of selecting some favourable spot for the settlement of his tribe.
    Delighted at the goodwill he manifested towards us, we had frequently
    invited him to dinner. But the traitor had far different designs. He
    made use of his visits to mark the exact spot to which our cattle were
    driven: he had determined to seize them, and it was with that object
    that he had hidden himself in the ravine with the troop which had
    taken me prisoner.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Adda saw them furiously disputing who should kill me, he
    exclaimed that I was an officer, and that Abd-el-Kader would give them
    much more for my head if it was left upon my shoulders, and would
    willingly replace the three horses they had lost if I were taken to
    him alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the Arabs still continued to brandish their yataghans over my
    head, with the most horrible imprecations against the dog of a
    Christian.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adda used still stronger arguments; and when the dying Arab had
    been removed, it was decided that I should be presented alive to
    Abd-el-Kader, who was to choose the manner of my death, after paying
    my ransom and replacing the horses which our men had shot.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was then released from the tree, and a rope was passed through the
    cord which bound my arms. An Arab took hold of either end, and we
    started for Old Arzew.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a march of two hours we reached Old Arzew. I was worn out
    with fatigue and suffering—naked, wounded, covered with dust and
    sweat, and dying of thirst: and I expected that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> my body would be
    left without burial at Arzew, while my head would serve to adorn
    Abd-el-Kader’s tent.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I was with the advanced guard of the Arabs, I was one of the first
    to arrive at Old Arzew. I threw myself upon the ground beside a
    fountain, and counted the troop which had attacked us as it defiled
    past me: there were about two hundred men. We halted for a quarter
    of an hour to rest the horses and to let the men eat a little. I was
    unable to swallow anything but a few figs and a little water, and had
    just dropped asleep when the chief gave the signal for departure, and
    I started under a guard of twenty-seven horsemen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as we were setting off, an Arab brought me a straw hat with
    poor Jonquié’s head in it, and bade me carry it. I refused, and was
    instantly assailed on all sides by blows and abuse, and cries of
    “Carry the head, dog of a Christian.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I will die first,” said I, throwing myself on the ground; and the
    Arabs were about to dispatch me with the butt ends of their rifles,
    when Adda, who was very anxious to deliver me alive to Abd-el-Kader,
    interposed. The head was hung to the saddle-bow of one of the Arabs,
    and after venting their ill-humour on me by more blows, we started.
  </p>

  <p>
    During our journey across the plain of Macta, we stopped at three
    successive wells, where several Arabs of the neighbouring tribes met
    us and drew water for our men and horses. I went towards the well to
    drink, but the Arab who held the bucket spat in my face, saying, “This
    water is not for a dog of a Christian like thee.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I made no answer, and went on to the next well, but there too the Arab
    who was drawing water spat in my face, and said, “This water is not
    for a dog of a Christian like thee.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Again I bore it with patience, but the Arab at the third well, not
    content with spitting in my face and addressing the same compliment to
    me as his predecessors had done, dashed a bucket full of water in my
    face. I was bathed in perspiration, and no doubt such treatment would
    have brought on an inflammation in my chest if I had had time to be
    ill. As it was, I shivered and threw myself on the ground, (always my
    last resource,) crying “You may kill me if you please; I will not move
    another step, I am dying of thirst.” This was no more than the truth,
    for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> my tongue and my mouth were like a piece of dry cork, and I was
    fainting from thirst. At length Adda went himself, drew some water and
    brought it to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    We resumed our journey through a country in which the barley harvest
    was going on, and every time we passed any Arabs at work in the
    fields or a party of horsemen, my guards called out “Come and see the
    Christian dog;” and they all came and spat in my face, and fired off
    their muskets close to my head, so that the balls whizzed about my
    ears. I must confess that these demonstrations of joy alarmed me a
    good deal until I got used to them.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the course of our day’s journey we had to ford several rivers;
    but though I was often up to my middle in the water, these barbarians
    would not allow me to take a little in the palm of my hand, till at
    last, in spite of their threats and blows, I flung myself down in the
    bed of the river and drank deep draughts: this refreshed me but for
    a short time, and at every fresh river I had to resort to the same
    expedient.
  </p>

  <p>
    At length I fell, exhausted with fatigue. It was three o’clock, and
    I had walked since five in the morning, and my feet were torn and
    bleeding. The Arabs mounted me on one of their horses, but in a
    quarter of an hour the owner of it dragged me off its back by my leg.
    I walked for two hours more, and then rode again. At length we arrived
    about nightfall at the camp of the Borgiá tribe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here I was exposed to the blows, insults, and spittings of men, women,
    and children. A tent was pitched for my guards into which I was but
    half admitted, and I lay on the earth beyond the carpet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our party had chickens boiled with kuskussu for supper, which they
    ate voraciously; I should have been very glad of a bit, but they
    considered me unworthy of such a dainty, and flung me a handful of
    kuskussu, which I could not swallow, as it was dry and bad, and my
    throat was so sore.
  </p>

  <p>
    After supper the Arabs returned my shirt to me and sent a negro to put
    irons on my feet. My legs were so swollen that the pain of forcing
    the irons to shut brought tears into my eyes: this treatment was as
    useless as it was cruel, for I was not able to stand, much less to run
    away. I stretched myself on the bare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> ground and slept soundly till
    the next morning, when the brutal negro woke me by giving a violent
    shake to the irons on my feet, which hurt me dreadfully.
  </p>

  <p>
    I endeavoured to rise but instantly fell again; my feet were lacerated
    and swollen, and all my wounds ached with cold and fatigue. The Arabs
    seeing that if they compelled me to walk I should soon expire by the
    road side, at length gave me a horse to ride, and we continued our
    journey towards Abd-el-Kader’s camp, which was not above ten leagues
    off. But for fear I should be too comfortable they hung poor Jonquié’s
    head at my saddle-bow: it was already in a state of putrefaction, and
    the Arabs seeing the horror and loathing with which it inspired me,
    amused themselves by piercing it with their swords and yataghans to
    increase the smell by exposing the brains to the action of the sun and
    air.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were travelling the road from Mascara to Mostaganem, and my heart
    beat for joy at the sight of the tracks of the French cannon. I hoped
    that we might fall in with some French outpost, and for a moment I
    forgot all my misery, and even the putrid and bloody head before me,
    and fancied myself on board the brig and in the arms of my friends
    and relations, or firing a broadside at the Arabs. I was rather
    roughly waked out of my reverie by a shower of blows which the Arabs
    gave me in order to hasten my horse’s pace. In a few minutes I urged
    the animal on, and immediately they beat me violently, crying, “A
    Christian dog like thee may not dare to strike the horse of an Arab.”
  </p>

  <p>
    We continued our journey in this manner for six hours, at the end of
    which the Arabs began to shout for joy, and Adda told me that we had
    reached Abd-el-Kader’s camp, which is close to the town of Kaala. It
    was not without emotion that I passed the first tents of the man who
    was to decide my fate.

    <div class="subhead">
      Arrival at Abd-el-Kader’s camp—His reception—Description
      of Abd-el-Kader—His tent—Unexpected meeting with M.
      Meurice—Abd-el-Kader’s officers.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Abd-el-Kader’s</span> camp stood in a grove of fig trees, on the road from
    Mascara to Mostaganem, and the tracks of the wheels of the French
    artillery were still visible in the very midst of it. On arriving at
    the first tent my guards forced me to dismount, and in a moment I was
    surrounded by a host of Arabs of every age and both sexes, shouting
    and screaming—“Son of dog,” “Dog of a Christian,” “Cut off his head,”
    &amp;c., with the usual accompaniment of blows and spitting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Presently the chaous came to my rescue, and by dint of vigorous blows
    they at last succeeded in delivering me from the hands of these
    savages, and conducted me to Abd-el-Kader’s tent. My first reception
    in the camp had not been of a kind fitted to dispel the fears with
    which I went into his presence. But as soon as Abd-el-Kader saw the
    pallor of my face he smiled and motioned me to sit, saying, “As long
    as thou art with me fear neither insult nor ill usage.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Emboldened by this gracious reception I asked him for something to
    drink, as, thanks to my guards, I had not drank since the day before.
    Abd-el-Kader immediately ordered me to be conducted to the tent which
    served as a store-house, and there I received a melon, some grapes,
    white bread, and water. The melon was so good, the water so cool,
    and Abd-el-Kader’s manner had been so humane, that my hopes and my
    appetite revived. After devouring the melon and drinking a whole jar
    of water, I was again led into the Sultan’s presence. His tent is the
    most magnificent in the camp: it is thirty feet long and eleven feet
    high; the inside is lined with hangings of various colours, covered
    with arabesques and crescents in red, blue, green, and yellow. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
    woollen curtain divides it into two unequal parts, in the furthermost
    and smaller of which is a mattress on which the Sultan sleeps. At the
    further end is a small entrance for the service of the tent and the
    slaves especially attached to the person of the Sultan: these are Ben
    Abu and Ben Faka, of whom I shall have to say more hereafter. During
    the day the tent remains open and accessible to all.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the ground in one corner lie four silken flags rolled up: these
    are borne before Abd-el-Kader on every march by four horsemen; the
    first flag, belonging to the cavalry, is red; the second, that of the
    infantry, has a horizontal yellow stripe between two blue ones; the
    third, two horizontal stripes—one green and the other white; and
    the fourth is half red and half yellow. Every Friday these flags are
    unfurled in front of the Sultan’s tent. There is also a small mattress
    covered with a carpet, on which lie two red silk cushions; at each
    end of the mattress is a chest, and behind it two other chests; the
    whole is then covered with a carpet and forms Abd-el-Kader’s sofa: the
    chests contain his clothes and money. A carpet is spread on the ground
    for strangers. These things, together with a high footstool, covered
    with red silk, which serves the Sultan as a horseblock, constitutes
    all the furniture of the Sultan’s tent. The tent is always guarded by
    thirty negroes, who are never relieved and have no other bed than the
    earth. A good many chaous are always in attendance, ready to obey the
    commands of their ruler.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will now endeavour to describe a man of whom at present very little
    is known. From all that I had heard, I expected to find a bloodthirsty
    barbarian, always ready to cut off heads: my expectations were false
    indeed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader is twenty-eight years of age and very small, his face is
    long and deadly pale, his large black eyes are soft and languishing,
    his mouth small and delicate, and his nose rather aquiline; his beard
    is thin but jet black, and he wears a small mustachio, which gives
    a martial character to his soft and delicate face, and becomes him
    vastly. His hands are small and exquisitely formed, and his feet
    equally beautiful; the care he takes of them is quite coquetish: he
    is constantly washing them, and paring and filing his nails with a
    small knife with a beautifully-carved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> mother-of-pearl handle, which he
    holds all the while as he sits crouching on his cushions with his toes
    clasped between his fingers.
  </p>

  <p>
    His dress is distinguished by the most studied simplicity; there is
    not a vestige of gold or embroidery on any part of it. He wears a
    shirt of very fine linen, the seams of which are covered with a silk
    braid terminating in a small silk tassel. Over the shirt is a haick,
    and over the haick two white bernouses; the uppermost garment is a
    black bernouse. A few silk tassels are the only ornaments about his
    dress; he wears no arms in his girdle, his head is shaved, and covered
    by three or four scull-caps one within the other, over which he draws
    the hood of his bernouse.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader’s father, who died about two years ago, was a marabout
    called Mahadin, who by means of his fortune, his intelligence, and his
    character for sanctity, had acquired very great fame and influence
    among the Arabs. Twice in his life he had made the pilgrimage to
    Mecca, and prostrated himself before the tomb of the Prophet. In his
    second journey he was accompanied by his son, who was but eight years
    old. Young as he was, Abd-el-Kader acquired a great deal of useful
    experience, and learned Italian: he could already read and write
    Arabic. After returning from their pious journey, Mahadin instructed
    his son in the difficult study of the Koran, and at the same time
    taught him the conduct of affairs.
  </p>

  <p>
    As soon as we had concluded a peace with the Arabs after the taking
    of Algiers, Abd-el-Kader employed himself in exciting the tribes to
    revolt, in feeding and exasperating their animosity towards us, in
    stirring up their religious fanaticism, and above all in endeavouring
    to obtain the sovereign power over them. This, the talent, the energy,
    the bravery, and the cunning of the young marabout soon procured for
    him; he quickly became their chief, and is now their Sultan.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second time that I went to the Sultan’s tent he was seated on
    some cushions with his Secretaries and some marabouts crouching
    in a semicircle on either side of him: his smiling and graceful
    countenance contrasted charmingly with the stupid savage faces around
    him. The Chief Secretary first attracted my attention by his Tartuffe
    expression, and the rogue has always persuaded Abd-el-Kader to ask a
    large sum for my ransom.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

  <p>
    The Sultan, with a smile of the greatest kindness, bade me be seated,
    and asked me, in Arabic, my name and where I was taken, and on my
    answering his questions, told me to fear nothing so long as I was with
    him.
  </p>

  <p>
    He then began to talk about our Generals who have commanded in Africa,
    and was very curious to know what had become of them all. On hearing
    the name of General Trézel, he flew into a violent rage, and cried,
    “He was author of all our misfortunes; it was he who broke the peace
    and caused such endless disasters!” I saw that he alluded to the
    battle of Tafna, by which General Bugeaud made up for the defeat at
    Macta, where we lost five hundred men.
  </p>

  <p>“How many horsemen did you lose at Tafna?” asked I.</p>

  <p>
    “How many?” cried he, furiously. “How many? What is that to thee? The
    Arabs were not killed at Tafna as the French were at Macta; you have
    never retrieved my great victory over you there. Five hundred of our
    men did not return from Tafna.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Now as the Arabs are the greatest liars in the world, one may fairly
    presume that General Bugeaud killed at least twelve hundred of them at
    Tafna; but I took very good care to make no further remark; and after
    a few moments of silence the Sultan smiled again and said—
  </p>

  <p>“Dost thou desire anything more to-day?”</p>

  <p>
    “I am quite naked, give me some clothes,” said I, and immediately, at
    a sign from Abd-el-Kader, I was taken to the store tent and furnished
    with a scull-cap, a very thin haick, a shirt, and a pair of slippers:
    my trowsers were also returned to me and I put them on, though all in
    rags, as no others were to be had.
  </p>

  <p>
    No sooner was I dressed, than I was accosted by a man, or rather a
    phantom, wrapped in a ragged haick, pale and emaciated, with a long
    uncombed beard, naked chest and meagre legs, and every appearance of
    having endured long and cruel misery; a smile lit up his wan dejected
    countenance as he said—
  </p>

  <p>“Don’t you recognise me, Sir?”</p>

  <p>“No, Sir, I am not aware that I ever saw you before,” said I.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

  <p>
    “Oh, that is because I have suffered so much since we met. I hear that
    you are a prisoner, and for your sake I am very sorry for it, for you
    do not yet know all the torments that await you; but I cannot conceal
    from you the joy your presence gives me. I shall no longer be alone;
    I shall have a companion who will share my sufferings, and to whom I
    can talk of my country and of my sorrows, and I shall suffer less. But
    have you really forgotten me, M. De France? I met you at dinner at M.
    Lafont’s.”
  </p>

  <p>“At M. Lafont’s? Good heavens! are you M. Meurice?”</p>

  <p>
    The unfortunate man wrung my hand, and his eyes filled with tears.
    I said everything I could think of to encourage and cheer him; but
    while I talked hopefully and gladly, my thoughts were occupied with
    poor Meurice’s wretched appearance: his face disfigured by pain, his
    extreme thinness, the feebleness of his limbs, and the dejection of
    his spirits, gave me the idea of a dying man. When I saw him at M.
    Lafont’s dinner at Algiers, he was a stout healthy man of about forty,
    good-looking, lively, and agreeable; but ill-usage and suffering
    had stupified him, destroyed all his energy and powers of mind, and
    unhinged his whole frame; he was now weak, credulous, almost imbecile.
    He had endured unheard-of tortures which I had escaped, and he had
    not, like me, been inured to hardships and privations by a sailor’s
    life.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tent in which we were lodged was as large as that of Abd-el-Kader,
    but not nearly so handsome: it served as a general magazine for
    victuals and ammunition. Near it was another which was used as the
    Sultan’s kitchen, and where, besides, all the barley and kuskussu for
    the troops was kept. A third tent contained all sorts of military
    stores and clothing, and the provisions of oil and butter.
  </p>

  <p>
    An old negro, called Ben Faka, was the governor of our tent: he was
    formerly a slave of Abd-el-Kader’s father; he has known the Sultan
    from his birth, and is extremely attached to him; with us he would be
    called the Commissary General.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sultan’s Treasurer is Ben Abu his old tutor: he has the care of
    Abd-el-Kader’s tent and treasure during the battle, and enjoys his
    entire confidence. Ben Abu stammers, owing to a shot which carried
    away half his teeth and half his tongue. He and Ben Faka are charged
    with the especial care of the Sultan’s person. The Commander of the
    troops is called Milud-ben-Arrach: he is always grave and solemn,
    and never smiles. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> Lieutenant is an Arab called Muftar, who has
    especial command over the horse. During the peace Muftar frequently
    came to Oran, where he saw the manœuvres of the French cavalry, and he
    has been trying ever since to discipline his Arabs in the same manner
    but totally without success, as the Arabs can never understand the
    possibility of keeping the line while charging at full speed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took care to impress the features of these different officers on
    my memory, in the hope that I might one day have an opportunity of
    repaying them their blows, insults, and odious persecutions with
    lashes, and the most cruel among them with bullets.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sultan has in his camp about two hundred and fifty horsemen
    and five hundred foot soldiers, who are paid and clothed at his
    expense; among the Arabs the cavalry are lodged in the centre of
    the camp, surrounded and guarded by the infantry. The Califah, or
    General-in-Chief, is encamped near Tlemsen with as many more, and
    it is with this handful of men that Abd-el-Kader drives all the
    neighbouring tribes to battle.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Meurice</span> begged me to give him an account of my capture and subsequent
    adventures. I had just finished it, and requested to hear his story in
    return, when a negro brought us some kuskussu for supper. It was quite
    dark, and he lit a taper of yellow wax, about the size of a farthing
    rushlight, stuck it on a bit of stick which he poked into the earth,
    and bade us lie down. We stretched ourselves upon the bare ground and
    the negro went away.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wish I were as well skilled in the management of my pen as in that
    of a vessel, so that I might be able to bring vividly before my
    readers a picture of the dark savage tent filled with strange-looking
    packages, and in it the two prisoners lying on the ground; Meurice,
    pale and livid, with his long matted beard and dim eyes, telling in a
    sad and weary voice, the unhappy adventure which had suddenly snatched
    him from a life of ease and enjoyment, and plunged him into the most
    frightful and degrading misery. I will give his story, as nearly as I
    can remember, in his own words.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I was compelled,” said he, “to leave Paris after the Revolution of
    1830, by losses in trade. I settled at Algiers with my young wife, and
    exercised the profession of a land surveyor, in which I had plenty of
    employment. My life, though rather monotonous, was very agreeable,
    thanks to Clarissa’s incessant attentions to my comfort, and to her
    charming disposition. Poor thing! she is so pretty, so amiable, you
    shall read her letters. Alas! perhaps I may never see her again.
  </p>

  <p>
    “On the 25th of April, 1836, I had been to inspect an estate near
    the Metidja, and was returning in company with M. Muller, a civil
    engineer, M. D—— and his sister. I was on horseback,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> M. Muller on
    a mule, and M. and Mlle. D—— in a carriage. On a sudden we were
    surrounded by a troop of Arabs: we were all totally unarmed, except
    M. D——, who had a gun; but he was so terrified, that without even
    firing it off, he darted out of the carriage, took to his heels and
    hid himself in a marsh, where the horsemen could not follow him. M.
    Muller received a ball in his thigh which hurt him severely, and
    was instantly taken prisoner. The Arabs next seized Mlle. D—— and
    endeavoured to force her to comply with their brutal desires, but
    threats, blows, and pistols held to her breast, failed to overcome
    her heroic resistance, and the noble girl was actually cut to pieces
    before our eyes without uttering a single cry.
  </p>

  <p>
    “The Arabs dragged M. Muller and myself away with them, but were soon
    obliged to leave M. Muller behind with the Hadjutes, seeing that
    he must inevitably sink under the fatigues of the journey. He was
    soon exchanged for three Arab prisoners. They resolved to sell me to
    Abd-el-Kader, and set out to join him at his camp. I was exposed to
    every possible kind of ill-usage on the road, blows, threats, insults,
    and degrading tortures of every kind. To give you one instance among
    many:—At the camp of one of the tribes on the plain, the Arabs
    stripped me entirely naked, tied my hands behind my back and fastened
    me to a tree, whereupon the women and children amused themselves the
    whole day with flinging stones at me and smearing my face with the
    most loathsome filth; you can form no idea of my sufferings, the
    intolerable stench of the filth, the incessant blow’s inflicted by the
    stones they threw at me; the children who pinched and bit my thighs
    all combined to make my torments unbearable.
  </p>

  <p>
    “After staying some time at Mascara we went to Abd-el-Kader’s camp,
    which was then in the neighbourhood of Tafna. The Sultan received
    me kindly and bought me of my captors. He was very melancholy and
    completely cast down by his recent defeat by General Bugeaud at
    Shikak. He had confidently predicted his own victory, founding his
    prophecy upon a passage of the Koran, which foretold the defeat of the
    Christians during the seventh year of their settlement in Africa.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Defeat destroyed all his influence; the Arabs forsook their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> Sultan
    and denied his authority; several of the tribes declared that they
    would no longer fight under his orders, but would undertake their
    own defence. They fled in all directions and destroyed everything
    that lay in their way; they did not even respect Abd-el-Kader’s camp,
    where they cut off and carried away half his tent and pillaged the
    provisions. It is a great pity that we had no light cavalry at that
    time, for it would have enabled us to seize Abd-el-Kader’s camp.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Immediately after this defeat, the Sultan threw himself into Mascara
    with fifty horse and a hundred foot, all inhabitants of the town and
    the sole remnants of his army. A report of a counter-march of General
    Bugeaud’s had spread a panic. Abd-el-Kader’s stores were pillaged, and
    he would never have recovered the blow but for the subsidies of all
    kinds which he constantly receives from Muley Abd-el-Rachman, Emperor
    of Morocco, without whose assistance he would be utterly unable to
    support an army.
  </p>

  <p>
    “When he saw that the Arabs, who but the day before had blindly
    submitted to his command, were now prepared to shake off his
    authority, the Sultan knew that the prisoners who remained in his camp
    were doomed to destruction. He resolved to save them, and commanded
    the thirty negroes who guard his tent to escort M. Lanternier a
    colonist, his wife a woman of forty, his daughter a lovely girl of
    fifteen, a German lady of about forty, another of about twenty who
    was taller and as handsome as Mlle. Lanternier, and myself, as far
    as Droma, and to protect us from the violence or the insults of the
    tribes we should pass on our way.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We started full of gratitude towards Abd-el-Kader, and of confidence
    in our negro guard, but scarcely had we gone five hundred yards, when
    the negroes suddenly halted, seized M. Lanternier, and myself, and
    bound us to a tree with our hands tied behind our backs. The scene
    which we were then compelled to witness is too hideous to describe;
    suffice to say, that the four wretched women became the victims of
    the brutal desires of our negro guard. Even now I often hear in my
    sleep our imprecations and cries of rage, the howls of the savages,
    and the sobs of the wretched women. Such is the obedience shown to the
    commands of the powerful Abd-el-Kader.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

  <p>
    “On arriving at Droma, M. Lanternier and I were thrown into a
    loathsome dungeon, and the four half-dead despairing women into
    another.
  </p>

  <p>
    “On the 31st July, Abd-el-Kader sent for me to Mascara, and thence to
    his camp; his manner towards me was as kind as before, and he again
    promised me a speedy release by exchange; he also desired me to send
    for my wife, adding the most solemn protestations, and for a moment
    the desire of seeing her again almost overcame me, but when I imagined
    her exposed to blows, threats, and insults, I immediately abandoned
    the selfish idea of dragging my Clarissa into the misery I was then
    enduring, and I refused the Sultan’s offer with many thanks. He then
    told me his motive for sending for me from Droma, and dictated to me
    several letters to Algiers and to Oran. I have only been in the camp a
    fortnight, and I am far better off here than in the prisons of Droma,
    or the tents of the tribes. The Sultan puts some restraint upon the
    hatred of the Arabs towards the Christians, and now your presence
    will console me under my misfortunes. Besides, you will easily gain
    the goodwill of Abd-el-Kader, and thus alleviate our hardships, and
    the Governor will be anxious to ransom you, and your deliverance will
    entail mine. And now good night, if you are cold draw near to me and
    we shall keep each other warm.”
  </p>

  <p>
    We were awakened very early next morning by the roll of a drum very
    ill beaten; I instantly rose and spent the whole day in wandering
    about the camp, and observing the habits and the discipline of
    Abd-el-Kader’s soldiery.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tents of the infantry are pitched in a circle which encloses those
    of the cavalry; each tent contains fifteen or twenty men whose horses
    are tethered outside with ropes tied round their fore-feet.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sultan’s tent stands in the very centre of the camp with an open
    space before it for his horses and those of his attendants: he always
    has eight or ten horses ready for his own use. A straight avenue is
    left from the front of his tent to the very edge of the camp where a
    cannon is placed with its muzzle turned towards the plain. This is
    the Sultan’s whole artillery, and in very bad order it is. When I was
    there it was mounted on a broken French carriage, and the touch-hole
    was so large that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> the powder flew out from it in a perfect stream of
    fire, and burned the hands of the Arabs who fired it. It was only used
    for salutes and rejoicings. Close to the cannon is the gunner’s tent.
    Behind Abd-el-Kader’s tent is that of the muleteers, and round it are
    picketed the mules which carry the baggage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Near the kitchen tent are a hundred camels which carry the barley and
    the biscuits for the soldiers, and a flock of sheep and goats, one of
    which is given to each tent every Friday. Each tent furnishes two men
    every night to guard the camp,—one watches from sunset till midnight,
    the other from midnight till daybreak. During the day there are no
    guards.
  </p>

  <p>
    As soon as it dawns the drum beats and the watch is relieved. A
    small quantity of detestable biscuit, full of dust and straw, is
    given to each soldier, and the horsemen give a measure of barley to
    their horses; they only let them drink once a day at five o’clock,
    <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> At four <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the soldiers have a meal of boiled
    barley, and the chiefs of kuskussu.
  </p>

  <p>
    The soldiers have nothing whatever to do, except that from time
    to time the Aga of the infantry, following the example of Muftar,
    endeavours to teach them the drill, in which he was formerly assisted
    by a German deserter from our Foreign Legion.
  </p>

  <p>
    The adventures of this German are strange enough. For a year after his
    desertion he was employed by Abd-el-Kader to drill his infantry, but
    in spite of his zeal and fidelity in the service of his new master, he
    every day heard the Arabs say that they would shoot him in the first
    battle, for that they would not submit to be commanded by a Christian
    hound. The German who did not think proper to await the execution
    of these threats, took advantage of the peace to go to Oran and
    present himself to our General. But the General wishing to conciliate
    Abd-el-Kader, wrote to inform him that he might send for the deserter
    and do with him as he pleased. Accordingly some chaous were sent
    to Oran, the deserter was given up to them, and they bound him and
    dragged him off. On the road they fell in with some French soldiers
    who were mending it, and the poor fellow began to call out lustily,
    “Help, my friends! you surely won’t let these rascals carry off your
    comrade who has fought them with you: help! they are going to cut off
    my head.” Hereupon the soldiers threw down their pickaxes, snatched up
    their muskets, and would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> certainly have effected a rescue but for a
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gendarme</i> who was sent to protect the chaous against any attempt of
    the kind.
  </p>

  <p>
    The poor fellow was taken to Mascara where he lay in chains a whole
    year. In his exasperation at the conduct of the French authorities he
    turned Mussulman, and was let out of prison; he refused to resume his
    employment of drill-sergeant, and took to manufacturing gunpowder at
    Mascara, but finding this trade insufficient for his support he went
    to Morocco, from whence he hopes to go to Italy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since then the Aga has laboured to teach his ragged and unruly
    soldiers himself, but with very small success: the little ragamuffins
    in the streets of Paris go through the exercise far better than
    Abd-el-Kader’s soldiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Arab cavalry now wear a red jacket and Turkish trowsers of the
    same colour, with a haick and a bernouse over them, and slippers
    on their feet; they have a rifle, a sabre, and a dozen cartridges
    in a box slung over the shoulder with a belt, which never leaves
    them. Their saddles are made of wood, with a loose cover of morocco
    leather, and so high before and behind that the rider sits as in a
    box; the stirrup leathers are very short and the stirrups very large,
    with sharp points which serve for spurs: they, however, wear spurs
    besides, which are mere iron spikes about eight or ten inches long.
    Only the horses belonging to merchants and destined for long journeys
    are shod, but none of Abd-el-Kader’s. The horsemen put six or eight
    coarse blankets on their horses’ backs to keep the wooden saddle from
    wounding them. In spite of this precaution, however, nearly all the
    Arab horses are galled on the back: they are never groomed but merely
    have some water dashed all over them when they are taken to drink;
    they are exposed by day and by night to rain, heat, and cold; and
    accordingly an Arab horse seldom lasts more than six years.
  </p>

  <p>
    The infantry wear a woollen vest, Turkish trowsers, a black jacket
    with a hood, and slippers: like the cavalry, they have a rifle, a
    cartridge box, and a knife at their girdle; the richest among them add
    to this a dagger, pistols, and a yataghan.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the camp as well as in all other places the Arabs pray six times a
    day,—at three, six, and eight in the morning, at noon, and at four
    and eight in the evening: at the hours of devotion the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> marabouts
    turn to the four cardinal points and call the faithful to prayer
    with a slow and solemn voice, saying “God is God, and Mahomed is his
    prophet; come and worship them.” A marabout then recites the prayer in
    each tent. The faithful begin by rubbing their hands and faces with
    dust; they respond to every act of devotion of the marabout with an
    inclination at the words “God is great,” and kiss the ground in token
    of humility; as soon as the prayer is ended they wash their faces.
  </p>

  <p>
    The band plays three times a day before Abd-el-Kader’s tent: three
    musicians standing, play the hautboy, three others, also standing,
    beat the tambourine with a stick, and three seated on the ground, play
    with small sticks upon bowls covered with goatskin. Their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">repertoire</i>
    is very scanty. I never heard more than three tunes, which they
    perform till the Sultan is tired and dismisses them by a sign.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each chief has a coffee-maker in his retinue. These coffee-makers
    erect a tent to which the Arabs go to drink coffee and smoke very bad
    green tobacco.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Meurice</span> and I were not the only Europeans in the camp, there were
    three Sardinian prisoners and two French deserters. The latter
    described to me in the strongest terms the misery they had to endure.
    In spite of their goodwill and their services the Arabs nearly starved
    them to death and treated them with the utmost contempt. They bitterly
    repented having forsaken their flag, and would have been overjoyed to
    return to it could they have been assured against being shot. One of
    the deserters, called Jean Mardulin, had rendered all kinds of good
    offices to Meurice; and indeed the poor fellow well deserved pardon,
    for the cruel treatment of the Arabs had punished him quite enough for
    his desertion.
  </p>

  <p>
    The three Sardinian prisoners appeared more wretched still. I begged
    one of them to give me an account of the manner in which he and his
    two companions had fallen into the hands of the Arabs, which he did as
    follows, after we had stretched ourselves on the ground in the tent.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Early in July 1836 the three Sardinian coral boats the St. John
    Baptist, the Conception, and the Jesus and Mary, arrived at a small
    uninhabited island or rather rock, situated at a few thousand yards
    from the shore between Cherchell and Mostaganem, near which the owner
    of the St. John Baptist and the Conception had discovered a rich bank
    of coral. We all three served as coral fishers on board these vessels.
    On arriving at the little island we found two barks, one stranded and
    the other afloat, the latter was manned by six Moors from Cherchell
    whom we had formerly known at Algiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We were delighted to fall in with people we knew, and im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>mediately
    asked the Moors whether we had anything to fear from the Arabs at
    Ténez. The Moors told us we need fear nothing, as the Arabs had no
    boats of their own and could not get to the island; they might,
    indeed, the Moors said, make use of their boats to come and attack
    us if they found out what we were doing; and in order to prevent any
    danger of such an event the Moors promised not to leave the island all
    the time our fishery lasted, on condition that we should supply them
    with provisions. We closed with their offer without hesitation, as we
    thought we had honest men to deal with, and had often taken a pipe
    and a cup of coffee with them at Algiers. Accordingly we shared our
    biscuit and brandy with them and began our fishery, which proved so
    abundant that in five days we had already got nearly a hundred pounds’
    worth of coral. We told the Moors how well pleased we were with the
    success of our fishery, and from that moment their manner was no
    longer so friendly towards us, and their faces betrayed agitation and
    disquiet.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Angelo Floria, the master of the St. John Baptist, was the first to
    remark the change that had taken place in the Moors, whose prolonged
    stay on a desert rock had already excited his suspicions. He had long
    frequented this coast, and knew how much he had to be on his guard
    against the Arabs: he therefore warned us not to trust our pretended
    friends too implicitly. Floria’s warning made a deep impression on the
    crews of the three boats, and on the morning of the sixth day we all
    resolved to leave our anchorage under the island and to withdraw to
    the westward of the Cape of Ténez, where we knew of a safe anchorage.
    Unfortunately the wind rose during the day, and the Conception and the
    Jesus and Mary were unable to double the cape and forced to return
    to the island. The master of the St. John Baptist had reached the
    anchorage, but when he found that the other two boats did not join
    him he came back to the island to look for them. Meanwhile, after
    anchoring the Conception and the Jesus and Mary, some of us landed
    on the island, where we were immediately assailed by a shower of
    balls, and a troop of Arabs, who had been brought by the Moors from
    Ténez, rushed upon us, brandishing their yataghans. Laurentio Figari,
    the master of the Jesus and Mary, was the first who fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> by their
    shot, and his head was instantly cut off with a yataghan. My two
    fellow-prisoners, a little boy, and myself fell into the hands of the
    Arabs. I received eight wounds from their yataghans while endeavouring
    to revenge myself on the rascals who had so basely betrayed us. The
    rest of the crew jumped into the sea and were shot by the Arabs, who
    then pillaged and burnt the Jesus and Mary and the Conception.
  </p>

  <p>
    “After sharing the plunder, the Arabs set out for Ténez. They
    halted about half way and deliberated whether they should kill us
    or not; after a long discussion they determined to take us alive to
    Abd-el-Kader, in hopes of getting some more money from him.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We stopped two days at Ténez, where the generous kindness of the
    inhabitants made up for the sufferings and privations of our journey.
    The Kait of Ténez visited us continually, and asked us numberless
    questions about the coral fishery: our account of it amused him very
    much, and he took great interest in our fate, and prevented the Arabs
    from beating us. I shall never forget the kindness of the women of
    Ténez, who never left me the whole time I was there, nor ceased from
    rubbing my wounds with butter and honey; they also gave us white
    bread and fruit, and overwhelmed the poor little boy with caresses. I
    could hardly believe that I was not at Genoa, instead of in a heathen
    country, so great was their charity.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We left Ténez on the third day and soon arrived at Abd-el-Kader’s
    camp, where we have been prisoners for a month. We do not know whether
    we shall be ransomed or exchanged, and we suffer continual misery and
    ill-usage, notwithstanding which my wounds are quite healed, and we
    all three hope that, with the assistance of the Blessed Virgin and the
    French Governor, we shall in the end recover our freedom and return
    home.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Abd-el-Kader sent the little boy to his wife, who is just as kind to
    him as the Arabs are cruel to us men. The Arab women will soon coax
    the poor child into forgetting the Blessed Virgin, his own country,
    and his mother, and they will teach him their prayers and make a
    Mahomedan of him. We have not seen him since we came here, but,
    perhaps, when Abd-el-Kader shifts his camp we may meet him somewhere.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

  <p>
    “I hope, Sir, that when you write to the Generals at Oran or Algiers
    you will not forget to say a word in favour of us three poor
    Christians.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I assured them that I would say as much for them as for myself,
    whereupon they took their leave.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had already asked the Sultan’s permission to write to Algiers and
    Oran, to acquaint the authorities with my captivity, and my arrival
    at Abd-el-Kader’s camp. At eight o’clock that evening I was conducted
    to his tent, where he gave me his own pen, made of a reed, a bit of
    coarse paper about the size of my hand, and his inkstand, which was
    made of brass, of an oblong shape, with an inkbottle at one end and a
    drawer for the pens at the other. A slave brought a brass candlestick,
    such as stand on the altar of a village church in France. I lay on
    the ground, and with the Sultan’s jewel-box for a table, I wrote one
    letter to Admiral Dufresne, and another to General Rapatel, describing
    the sufferings of Abd-el-Kader’s captives, and entreating them to
    negotiate our exchange as quickly as possible. I then delivered the
    two letters to Abd-el-Kader, who promised to forward them next day.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were awakened very early in the morning by the chief of our tent
    shouting, “Dogs of Christians, sons of dogs, get up! the tent is
    coming down, for the Sultan has ordered the camp to be raised.” Scarce
    were the words out of his mouth than the whole tent came tumbling down
    upon Meurice and myself. This was one of the thousand pleasantries
    with which the Arabs continually entertained us. We were still
    struggling to disentangle ourselves from the tent, in which we lay
    caught like fish in a net, when a drum beat the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reveille</i>, which was
    followed in a few minutes by the signal of march for the infantry,
    which accordingly started. The camels, mules, and pack horses were
    immediately loaded with all the camp equipage, stowed in panniers
    woven of the leaves of the dwarf palm. A third beat of the drum gave
    the signal of departure to the muleteers and camel drivers. Meurice
    and I were placed in the centre of this detatchment, which was under
    the command of Ben Faka. In obedience to the Sultan’s order, we were
    mounted on the two mules which carry Abd-el-Kader’s own coffers; the
    Italian sailors were worse off,—they rode on camels. Among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
    baggage I observed eight very ill-joined chests; these contained the
    reserve cartridges.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenever the camp is raised Abd-el-Kader, who, like every other Arab,
    begins his prayers at three in the morning, does not cease from them
    until all the other tents are struck, and it is time for the slaves to
    strike his, he then quits it, and seats himself at a short distance on
    a silken cushion surrounded by the marabouts and chiefs. Meanwhile the
    horsemen assemble, and place themselves in a line on his right hand,
    with Muftar at their head, and the thirty negro slaves are drawn up
    in a line on his left. The chiefs and the marabouts next mount their
    horses, and as soon as the baggage has passed the limits of what was
    the camp, a slave comes forward leading the Sultan’s horse, followed
    by another bearing the footstool which he uses as a horseblock.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader’s favourite horse is a magnificent black charger; he
    is the best rider I ever saw among the Arabs; and as his legs are
    disproportionately short for the length of his body, the Arab fashion
    of short stirrups, by concealing this defect, sets off his figure to
    great advantage, and his appearance on horseback is at once graceful
    and imposing. As soon as the Sultan is mounted, the chiefs give the
    signal of departure; the nine musicians ride at the head of the
    column, followed by eight Arabs bearing long rifles in red cloth
    cases; I have often asked leave to examine them, but the Arabs always
    answered, “They are the arms of the Sultan; a dog of a Christian like
    thee is not worthy to behold them.” Next come four more horsemen
    bearing the four flags which I have already described, and then
    Abd-el-Kader, in the centre of a line of horsemen: behind him are the
    thirty negroes, and they are followed by all the rest of the cavalry
    pell mell. The Arabs never set out on an expedition until the sun has
    risen.
  </p>

  <p>
    No order or discipline is kept on their marches; thus, if a soldier
    sees a fruit tree or a solitary tent he leaves the line to strip the
    one or pillage the other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two strangely-harnessed mules, more lean and broken-winded than
    hackney coach horses, drag the solitary cannon. Not a day passes on
    which it is not overturned and half buried in the mud. I hope, for the
    sake of the poor gunners, that it will at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> be left behind fast
    stuck, which will save them a vast deal of useless trouble and burning
    of their fingers.
  </p>

  <p>
    We left El Kaala on the 17th of August, and reached the plain of
    Mostaganem at one o’clock the same day, where we encamped, at a
    distance of four leagues from the town. The Arabs always turn their
    tents with the opening towards the east, and such accuracy do they
    acquire by habit, that at whatever time they pitch their tents they
    are invariably greeted by the first rays of the rising sun. Ben Faka
    determines the situation of the camp, and superintends in person the
    erection of the Sultan’s tent and the watering of the ground all about
    it. These arrangements are scarcely completed when the screeching of
    the music announces the approach of Abd-el-Kader. A number of horsemen
    detatch themselves from the main body, which they precede by about
    ten minutes, and gallop to the camp, where they suddenly wheel round,
    and return at full speed to meet the advancing column, aiming their
    rifles full at the Sultan all the while. When they are within shot
    of him they turn their guns a little aside, and send their bullets
    whistling about his ears. This salute goes on till he is within the
    camp, when the horsemen range themselves in a line on the right of the
    tent, and the thirty negroes on the left, the band plays as loud as
    ever it can, and the cannon announces the arrival of Abd-el-Kader to
    the neighbouring tribes: the Sultan makes his horse prance along the
    line formed by his cavalry, and glances proudly around him, two slaves
    open the curtains of the tent, the horse rears and neighs violently as
    he enters it and tramples upon the carpet, while the Arabs stand in
    open-mouthed admiration of the grace and activity of their Sultan; the
    faithful Ben Faka offers his back to assist his lord in dismounting,
    and a slave leads away the horse and walks him up and down before the
    tent for ten minutes; the marabouts and chiefs surround Abd-el-Kader,
    who orders the drums to beat, upon which the ranks are broken and men
    and horses repair to the tents, which the baggage attendants have
    already pitched for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chiefs of the neighbouring tribes on hearing the sound of the
    cannon hasten to pay their respects to the Sultan; they crowd pell
    mell into his tent, rush upon Abd-el-Kader, who is seated on his sofa,
    and kiss his hand, the hood formed by the folds of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> haick, and the
    skirts of his bernouse; in return he makes the motion of kissing their
    hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    On this occasion very few of the neighbouring Arabs came to salute
    him, as most of them were allied with the French; and in the evening
    only a little kuskussu was brought to feed his troops.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the middle of the night the drums beat a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reveille</i>, everybody
    jumped up, and the report was spread that Ibrahim, Bey of Mostaganem,
    had made a sortie with his troops, and was about to attack
    Abd-el-Kader. The Sultan left the camp at the head of all his cavalry
    to reconnoitre the movements of the Bey. I lay down behind a package,
    very indifferent to all the confusion and excitement which prevailed
    in the camp, and slept soundly while poor Meurice vainly sought for
    me in all directions, and at last, fancying I had made my escape,
    was in perfect despair, and wandered about mentally accusing me of
    unkindness, until I awoke and put an end to his distress.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader returned to the camp at daybreak, without having fallen
    in with Ibrahim, and brought back the news that the French troops had
    left Oran four days before. As he was by no means reassured as to
    the Bey’s movements, he ordered the camp to be raised, and by eleven
    o’clock the same morning we were back again within five minutes’ walk
    of El-Kaala.
  </p>

  <p>
    The inhabitants of the town, whose resources were already exhausted by
    the support of his troops, were so ill-pleased at the Sultan’s return
    that none of them came to pay their respects to him, and the Turks
    living in the town fled into the mountains carrying with them all
    their money. As soon as the Sultan became aware of their disaffection,
    he repaired to Kaala with fifty horsemen, and soon returned with a
    cargo of carpets and other articles which had been taken by main force
    from the most refractory of the citizens, who now fired a salute to
    testify the joy they felt at the Sultan’s presence, while their goods
    were being distributed before Abd-el-Kader’s tent.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">On</span> the 23rd of August, at five in the morning, we again left Kaala,
    and marched northward; after a march of seven hours, we encamped on
    the very edge of the plain of Mostaganem, near the river Scheliff.
    Our camp stood in a grove of ilexes and gum trees on the top of a
    mountain, commanding the plain; just such a spot as was selected by
    knights of old to build their castles on, for the better convenience
    of robbing travellers, oppressing their serfs, and defending
    themselves against their neighbours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader’s tent was pitched near a fresh and abundant spring, and
    the weather being oppressively hot, Zaka, the Sultan’s cup-bearer,
    ordered the slaves to dig two little channels to convey the water
    to the tent, where it was received into trenches immediately under
    the hangings, which were raised just enough to admit a current of
    air cooled by the water which surrounded the tent, and gave it the
    appearance of an island.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am too poor a hand at my pen, to attempt a description of the
    beautiful and fertile plain which lay at our feet covered with crops
    of various kinds, fruit trees, herds, flocks and tents. In spite of my
    position I could not help sharing the general satisfaction inspired by
    this delightful scene which promised such plentiful supplies to the
    troops. Abd-el-Kader, in a fit of generosity and good humour, sent me
    twelve pieces of eight moussounés each, (almost four shillings,) which
    I was to share with Meurice. This munificent and public manifestation
    of goodwill raised my spirits, and filled me with the hope of a speedy
    deliverance, which was strengthened by the knowledge that the Arabs,
    whom General Bugeaud had carried as prisoners to Marseilles, were as
    impatient as myself to be restored to freedom and to their country.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

  <p>
    In the morning a supply of melons, peaches, figs, and grapes arrived
    at the camp, and we feasted on what fell to our share; the grapes were
    better than the very best in France. I spent a few hours in wandering
    about and admiring the beauty of the scenery, and then stretched
    myself in the shade and indulged in a reverie, out of which I was
    awakened at about four in the afternoon by the arrival of all the
    surrounding tribes, who came to bring their subsidies. Each tribe was
    preceded by its Kait, on horseback and armed only with a stick, then
    came all the tribe—men, women, and children, two and two, bearing
    on their heads dishes filled with kuskussu; the richest Arabs walked
    apart from the line carrying whole sheep, spitted and roasted on a
    stake. When they had reached Abd-el-Kader’s tent, the chief of each
    tribe stepped forward and informed him that they had brought the
    tribute, the Arabs set their dishes on the ground before the tent
    and thrust the points of the spits on which the sheep were impaled
    into the ground. These dishes of kuskussu crowned, some with honey,
    some with hard eggs, some with raisins, others with boiled fowls or
    quarters of mutton, wore a most varied and tempting appearance. The
    Arabs then rushed into the tent to present their respects to the
    Sultan, while several of them took advantage of the confusion to
    steal the viands spread upon the earth, and it was only by the most
    vigorous application of their sticks that the Kaits could succeed in
    maintaining tolerable order. Abd-el-Kader then cast a glance upon the
    dishes disposed before his tent, and Ben Faka distributed them among
    the troops.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the Sultan had finished his repast, Ben Faka, who always serves
    it, brought the remains to our tent. A piece of leather was spread
    in the centre of the carpet, and a dish of kuskussu which had been
    begun by the Sultan was placed upon it. Ben Faka and several marabouts
    squatted in a circle round the leathern tablecloth, and began to
    devour the kuskussu and a sheep which we had for supper, without any
    bread, tearing the mutton with their fingers, and throwing the bones
    and scraps back into the dish, as the Sultan had done before them.
    When they had eaten their fill, the dish passed into third hands,
    and formed the supper of Abd-el-Kader’s slaves, who gnawed the bones
    and scraps of meat like so many dogs. During this last stage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
    repast Ben Faka called Meurice and me and threw us a piece of meat,
    which we ate in the Arab fashion with our fingers and without bread:
    he also bestowed upon us a handful or so of kuskussu. The water was
    brought in goat skins, and all the guests drank out of the same bowl
    which was never washed. I need not add that the prisoners were always
    served last. In spite of all this we thought our dinner excellent, and
    in order worthily to conclude a repast in which we had eaten meat, I
    asked Ben Faka’s leave to have coffee brought to us.
  </p>

  <p>“Coffee for a Christian hound!” said he; “and who is to pay for it?”</p>

  <p>
    “Did not the Sultan give me six pieces (two shillings), this morning?”
    replied I; “and shall I not whenever I am exchanged proclaim his
    munificence to my fellow-countrymen?”
  </p>

  <p>
    These words softened the hard heart of Ben Faka, and he ordered his
    coffee-maker to bring us some coffee. He then began to boast to us of
    the power and the wealth of his master and of his own influence with
    him, and exhibited, with the greatest pride, a snuff-box with a little
    mirror in the lid,—a treasure which excited indescribable envy and
    admiration among all the Arabs who were present. We soon perceived
    that the drift of his conversation was to induce us to solicit his
    protection and to offer him presents, and poor Meurice, who was always
    on the watch for an opportunity of conciliating his tormentors,
    immediately promised to send him a gold snuff-box from Algiers as soon
    as he was set free. The delight of this Arab minister of finance, and
    his promises of kindness to the dog of a Christian, may easily be
    conceived.
  </p>

  <p>
    The slave of Ben Faka’s coffee-maker interrupted our conversation by
    bringing the coffee in two little earthenware cups on a tin tray: the
    cups have no handles, but are fixed in small brass saucers; the coffee
    seemed to me delicious—it was served with the grounds; and the two
    cups sweetened with brown sugar, and a couple of pipes to smoke, cost
    a penny.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even now I cannot think of that day without emotion: it was so unlike
    all the rest of my captivity; we suffered neither ill usage, cold,
    nor hunger; the weather was beautiful, we had plenty of fruits, and
    Abd-el-Kader and Ben Faka were even kind to us: in short, to us it was
    a day of positive enjoyment.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

  <p>
    It has been asserted that Abd-el-Kader received no supplies from
    Morocco; this statement is contradicted by facts which I myself
    witnessed. On the 7th of August, 1836, a convoy arrived at the
    Sultan’s camp, from Morocco, bringing flints, scull-caps, slippers,
    trowsers, and cloaks enough for six hundred men. On the 15th of
    August there came fifteen camels loaded with powder and ball, also
    from Morocco. On the 25th of August Abd-el-Kader received from
    Morocco a store of biscuits and saltpetre. Every time that these
    supplies arrived at the camp the Arabs testified the greatest joy and
    exultation, and received the chief of the convoy with the same honours
    that they pay to Abd-el-Kader.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 28th of August two Arab spies came to the camp, one of them
    bringing a number of gun-flints which he had bought at Oran, and the
    other some despatches entrusted to him by the French authorities at
    Tlemsen for the Commandant at Oran, and to which he was to take back
    an answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader unsealed them, and having sent for Meurice, ordered him
    to read them. Meurice obeyed, and the Sultan resealed and sent them on
    to their address.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few days after, the same Arab filling the double office of courier
    to the French and spy to Abd-el-Kader, returned to the camp with the
    answer from General Létang the Commandant of Oran, to the Commandant
    of Tlemsen. Abd-el-Kader sent for me, and after very carefully
    unsealing General Létang’s letters, he ordered me to read them aloud.
    In them the General informed the Commandant of Tlemsen, that he had
    returned from his expedition against the Beni Amers, having achieved
    it without striking a single blow, and that he had plundered the
    silos<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the Arabs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The officers of the brig Loiret, added General Létang, were foolish
    enough to go out shooting at Arzew, and Lieutenant De France fell into
    the hands of the Arabs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took very good care not to read the first part of the letter, but
    only what related to myself.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

  <p>“Is that all?” said the Sultan; “surely thou hast deceived me?”</p>

  <p>“Read it yourself,” said I, “and you will see.”</p>

  <p>
    I was certain he could not read French, although he speaks it pretty
    well. I was then dismissed, and on returning to the tent I informed
    Meurice of what had just happened; and it was fortunate for me that I
    did so, for scarce had I finished my story when a marabout came in and
    summoned him to appear before the Sultan, and had he read what I had
    passed over, no doubt the chaous would soon have disabled me from ever
    telling that Abd-el-Kader opens the despatches of our generals.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    On the 29th of August the camp was again broken up, and after a march
    of six hours we halted on the banks of the Ouet Mina, a narrow but
    very rapid stream which rises to the east of Tekedemta and falls into
    the Schellif at about six leagues from the coast. The Schellif, which
    is the principal river of the country, rises among the mountains to
    the south of Milianah, runs from east to west, and falls into the sea
    near Cape Ivi, between the Cape of Ténez and the Gulf of Arzew.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ben Faka placed the camp on a hill adjoining the chain of mountains
    which overlooks the western part of the plain of Milianah. The site
    was as beautiful as the one we had just left: not far from our tent
    was a lofty cascade, the waters of which fell into the plain below,
    where they soon disappeared. If they were received in a basin and
    thence carried in small channels over the plain, the parched earth
    would soon be changed into green meadows which would afford far better
    food for the cows and horses of the Arabs than the weeds and briars
    which they are now forced to eat; and the harvests of wheat and barley
    would be very abundant; for though the Arab plough only scratches the
    very surface of the earth, I have seen one grain of wheat produce six
    or eight stalks. This province generally has very few trees, but the
    mountains which surround it are covered with ilexes and gum trees.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader laid a double tax upon the surrounding tribes to punish
    them for having given a favourable reception to Ibrahim, Bey of
    Mostaganem. Every day the horsemen brought to the camp great booty in
    horses, sheep, and oxen; and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> Abd-el-Kader’s tent the whole day
    was passed in counting the money which had been seized: this does not
    imply that the sums were immense, but that the Arabs count over their
    money ten or fifteen times. The Chief Secretary, whom by virtue of his
    office I am bound to consider as the most enlightened man in the camp,
    used frequently to come into our tent, and crouching behind a bale of
    goods, entirely hidden under his haick, count and recount his money
    for hours together.
  </p>

  <p>
    In spite of the most stringent measures and of the zeal displayed by
    the Kaits in collecting the tribute, it was hard to make the Arabs
    pay it, and Abd-el-Kader sent a party of horsemen to their tents, who
    returned in the evening laden with every kind of booty, and driving
    before them herds of horses, cattle, sheep, women, children, and
    negroes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the news of the arrival of these prisoners a number of Arabs came
    to the camp, in order to see whether they might not be able to buy a
    few negroes, or a woman or so, a bargain. If, after casting a rapid
    glance over the slaves who were crouching on the ground, the buyer saw
    one whose appearance struck his fancy, he made him rise and examined
    all his limbs, as we examine a horse or a bull, made him open his
    mouth, and, if it was a woman, pressed her breasts to see whether
    there was milk in them. The unfortunate wretches bore it all with
    the most perfect indifference, and when the bargain was struck, they
    followed their new masters with an air of utter insensibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the prisoners for sale who were in our tent, was a beautiful
    black girl of about fourteen; she had large soft black eyes, lips like
    coral, and teeth like the pearls set in the handle of a yataghan;
    her legs were like those of a race horse, and her feet and hands
    smaller than those of a Spanish woman; her shape was perfect, and the
    slenderness of her waist contrasted beautifully with the fulness of
    her hips; for the poor girl, contrary to the custom of the women of
    this country, had confined her white haick round her middle with a red
    worsted cord. Her beauty and the fineness and cleanliness of her dress
    clearly showed that she had been the property of wealthy people. The
    poor girl laid herself on the ground beside me, weeping and lamenting,
    and refused the food that was offered to her.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seeing her so beautiful and so unhappy, I tried to comfort her;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> but
    she said, “I was so happy in the tent from which they robbed me, and
    now I shall be made to sleep outside with the horses: I shall have no
    kuskussu to eat, and I shall wear a torn and dirty haick;” and she
    wept again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before long, a chief of the Garrabas came into the tent: he had
    brought the head of a French soldier whom he had surprised that
    morning in a field near Mostaganem, so that he was welcome in the
    camp. He was rich and wanted to buy slaves. At the sight of the young
    negress his eyes brightened with pleasure, and he ordered her to rise.
    The slave obeyed, she was subjected to the most minute examination
    and found faultless. The Garraba turned to Ben Faka, and said, “Fifty
    boutjous?”
  </p>

  <p>“I must have eighty boutjous (<em>10l.</em>) for her,” said Ben Faka.</p>

  <p>“She is not worth them.”</p>

  <p>“Did’st thou ever see so beautiful a negress?—Open thy mouth.”</p>

  <p>The slave obeyed.</p>

  <p>“Look, what teeth! there is not one missing!—Walk.”</p>

  <p>The slave walked.</p>

  <p>
    “What hips! what a firm and graceful step! She is a virgin too.—Open
    thy haick and thy shift.”
  </p>

  <p>The slave did as she was commanded.</p>

  <p>
    “Press her breasts; she has no more milk than a new-born lamb. Don’t
    weep slave, or the chaous shall dry thy tears with his stick.”
  </p>

  <p>The girl wiped her eyes.</p>

  <p>“Eighty boutjous.”</p>

  <p>
    “Sixty. She is not strong; she will not be able to carry the dung out
    of the stable.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “In two years she will carry the dung of all the horses belonging to
    thy tent. Eighty boutjous.”
  </p>

  <p>“Seventy.”</p>

  <p>
    “Her hands are delicate; she has never worked. Eighty boutjous. Yea or
    nay? the Sultan waits for me.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The Garraba paid them and bade his slave follow him; the poor girl
    left the tent fixing on me her eyes bathed in tears. I saw the Garraba
    stop at the Sultan’s tent to receive the price of the Frenchman’s
    head, and in a few minutes they left the camp, and I lost sight of the
    poor black girl.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">On</span> the 2nd of September the courier from Tlemsen brought several
    letters which Abd-el-Kader opened, read, sealed, and sent to their
    destination.
  </p>

  <p>
    The energetic measures taken by Abd-el-Kader against the neighbouring
    tribes had failed in reducing them to complete submission; they
    only waited for an opportunity to shake off his authority. One of
    Abd-el-Kader’s uncles, a marabout, declared himself independent of the
    Sultan, and refused to pay the tribute: he was immediately joined by
    the Beni-Flitas and Houledscherifs, two numerous, rich, and powerful
    tribes which inhabit a part of the country watered by the Ouet Mina
    and the adjoining mountains. They refused any longer to acknowledge
    Abd-el-Kader as their Sultan, and submitted to the authority of his
    uncle.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sultan again sent a party of horsemen to claim the tribute from
    his uncle, who instead of paying it, sent the following answer:—
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

  <p>
    “Thou wert nothing before the coming of the French; thou wert nothing
    until thou hadst made a peace with those unbelievers. I was greater
    and holier than thou; and it was in the hope of usurping my authority,
    O Abd-el-Kader, that thou madest a treaty with the Christians; to them
    thou owest thy greatness and thy power. When thou thoughtest thyself
    great enough, thou brakest the treaty with the French, and now thou
    wilt that we should acknowledge thee as our Sultan. But I have ever
    been greater and holier than thou, and never will I bow before thee.
    Neither will I pay the tribute which thy horsemen demand in thy name.”
  </p>

  <p>
    This letter, of which I remember only the most striking passages,
    threw Abd-el-Kader into a state of melancholy and indecision which
    lasted several days, and spread general consternation in the camp. The
    Arabs saw with horror that they would perhaps be compelled to turn
    their weapons against their brethren, and they felt that a civil war
    among themselves would secure for ever the dominion of the French.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader sent courier upon courier to his uncle to persuade him to
    submission, but the marabout was deaf to all his arguments, and always
    returned the same answer—“I have ever been greater and holier than
    thou, O Abd-el-Kader, and never will I acknowledge thee as my Sultan.
    Send no more horsemen unto me for I will not pay tribute to thee.”
    While these negotiations were going on, Abd-el-Kader called together
    all the tribes on the banks of the Ouet Mina and the Schellif, but
    they were unwilling to involve themselves in hostilities with their
    neighbours. Scarce a hundred horsemen answered the summons, and these
    nearly all took flight after the first day: those who remained were
    watched and kept within the camp.
  </p>

  <p>
    Desertion had already begun among the Sultan’s regular troops, and
    a spirit of bitter discontent and depression reigned throughout the
    camp. Several of the tribes, when threatened by Abd-el-Kader, replied
    that they knew the way to Mostaganem, and that if he molested them
    they would go and place themselves under the protection of the French.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hereupon Abd-el-Kader seized the principal chiefs: four of them were
    kept in the camp with their feet in irons; four others, chained
    together by the neck, were thrown into prison at Mascara.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 8th of September a troop of horsemen brought nine Jews whom
    they had seized in the environs of Mostaganem, and the heads of three
    Turks whom they had killed. The Jews had been cruelly treated by the
    Arabs; they were chained together by the throat, their feet were torn
    and bruised, and their bodies covered with wounds. When they were
    brought before the Sultan they resorted to a lie, (if indeed it be a
    lie to deceive an enemy in order to save one’s life,) and said that
    when the French took Mostaganem they had fled to Mascara with their
    families and their possessions, that the French had forced them to
    return to Mosta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>ganem, and that they were again trying to escape to
    Mascara when the horsemen seized them. The Sultan upon hearing this
    bade them send for their property and their families, and return to
    Mascara; adding, that if they obeyed, no harm should befall them, but
    if not, that their heads should keep company with those of the three
    Turks.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Abd-el-Kader is great, powerful, and holy,” said the poor Jews; “and
    we will go and dwell in Mascara with our wives, our children, and our
    goods.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The three Turks’ heads and that of the French soldier which the
    Garraba had brought, were exhibited in front of the Sultan’s tent for
    two days; on the third the children had them to play with, after which
    they were thrown outside the camp to the birds of prey.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the morning of the 10th of September Abd-el-Kader started, with
    all his forces and the solitary cannon, to attack the Flitas and
    Houledscherifs, leaving one man to each tent to guard the camp. The
    insurgent tribes, who were prepared for an attack, had already sent
    their women, children, and cattle up into the mountains, and the
    Sultan found them drawn up in order of battle on the high mountain
    which skirts the plain of Milianah, at the marabout nearest to the
    Ouet Mina and the Schellif. The fight lasted the whole day, and the
    cannon was fired seven or eight times, loaded with stones in default
    of balls. In the evening Abd-el-Kader returned to the camp, bringing
    back twelve dead and eight wounded. I never could obtain any precise
    account of the result of the battle, but the dejection of the Sultan
    and his troops plainly showed that they had not been victorious. The
    horsemen brought back five heads and drove before them a troop of
    women and children who had not been able to reach the mountains: the
    unfortunate creatures were all thrown into the prisons of Mascara. One
    man had been taken alive: he was brought before the Sultan as soon as
    the latter had dismounted.
  </p>

  <p>“Thou wert taken among the rebels?”</p>

  <p>“I was.”</p>

  <p>“What hast thou to say in thy defence?”</p>

  <p>“I was compelled to fight against thee.”</p>

  <p>“Thou shouldest then have fled to my camp.”</p>

  <p>“But”—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

  <p>“Enough.”</p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader raised his hand, and the unhappy man was dragged away by
    the chaous. One of the chaous had lost his son in the battle, and had
    seen his head hanging to the saddle-bow of a Beni-Flita: with tears
    and lamentations he now implored the other chaous to grant him the
    favour of putting the prisoner to death with his own unaided hand. He
    at last obtained it, and immediately rushed upon the Beni-Flita, and
    cut off his hands and feet with his yataghan. The children shouted
    for joy at this horrid sight, and the revengeful father watched with
    delight the hideous contortions of the victim who rolled in the dust
    at his feet, shrieking with rage and pain, and imploring his tormenter
    to cut off his head. When the Beni-Flita at length fainted from loss
    of blood, the chaous passed a rope round his middle, and dragged him
    by it outside the enclosure of the camp; the children brought together
    a quantity of brushwood and dry branches, and set fire to them, and on
    this pile the chaous threw the still living Beni-Flita.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was night, and the flames threw a lurid glare upon the dark tents:
    the piercing shrieks of the Beni-Flita long sounded through the camp.
    I covered my head with my haick, and groaned when I thought that only
    a few leagues from this savage camp were the outposts of a noble and
    generous nation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within a few days of my arrival at Abd-el-Kader’s camp I was covered
    with the lice with which the Arabs are infested. The Sultan himself
    in the midst of the most serious discussion picks them off his haick,
    rolls them gravely between his finger and thumb, and throws them upon
    the carpet. These vermin are of a monstrous size, white with a black
    stripe along the back, which swells with the blood they suck from
    their unhappy victims. Fortunately for us, they did not much frequent
    our hair and beards, but they laid their eggs in the seams of our
    clothes, and were hatched upon us in myriads. The Arabs are so used
    to them that they treated us with the greatest scorn when they saw
    our efforts to rid ourselves of these tormenters. One day we asked
    Abd-el-Kader to allow us to bathe in the Ouet Mina, in order to wash
    off the vermin and the dust with which our bodies were covered. The
    Sultan granted our request, and sent one of his negroes to protect us
    against the Arabs. I cannot describe the pleasure of stretching our
    weary and heated limbs in the clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> cool water; but in two days the
    dust and the lice were as bad as ever. We slept on the bare ground,
    and as the nights were intensely cold we crept close to each other,
    but as soon as the blood began to circulate at all in our benumbed
    bodies the lice resumed their attacks, and we again sought the cold to
    escape from their intolerable pricking.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the day after the battle, the 11th of September, the camp was
    raised at daybreak, and from sunrise till three o’clock, p.m., we
    marched towards the south-east along horrible roads, over mountains
    covered with gum trees, beeches, junipers, and ilexes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ben Faka pitched the camp on a fine <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i>, from whence we could
    see the traces of the habitations of the Beni-Flitas, who had joined
    Abd-el-Kader’s uncle. As soon as the usual salute had been fired, the
    horsemen, without even giving their horses time to breathe, started
    in all directions, to plunder the silos of the Beni-Flitas. They soon
    returned laden with wheat, barley, and straw, but no roast mutton or
    kuskussu was brought that evening.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Abd-el-Kader found that all the inhabitants of the district had
    left it and joined the refractory marabout in the mountains, and that
    he was in danger of wanting provisions, he determined to move the camp
    again, and accordingly we marched for some days through a perfectly
    deserted country.
  </p>

  <p>
    At length, on the 17th of September, after a southward march of eight
    hours, we came to an inhabited district. A few tribes brought some
    horses and a little money to the Sultan, but these supplies were few
    and scanty. An Arab came from Mascara with the news that General
    Létang had left Oran, and that the Garrabas had taken a great number
    of cattle and sheep from the Douairs. The loss sustained by the
    Douairs caused great rejoicing in our camp, and the horsemen galloped
    about firing their rifles in honour of the victorious Garrabas.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 19th of September the tents were again struck, and after five
    hours’ march Ben Faka halted on the slope of a mountain just below a
    marabout which was flanked by a tower at each corner. The surrounding
    country was well peopled, and the fields covered with wheat and
    barley. From the heights above us, one could see the tents of the
    tribes dotted about the plain and the slope of the mountain.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

  <p>
    At about six hours’ march from this place are the ruins of the ancient
    city of Tekedemta, which Abd-el-Kader had long wished to rebuild; and,
    with the view of obtaining from the neighbouring tribes provisions and
    assistance of all kinds towards this undertaking, he now remitted to
    them the payment of tribute, at the same time telling the Kaits that
    he should expect to receive at Tekedemta all that they would otherwise
    have brought to him now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next day, the 20th of September, we left the marabout with the four
    towers and marched to the neighbourhood of Tekedemta. While the troops
    were employed in preparing the tents, Abd-el-Kader mounted a fresh
    horse, and went to visit the ruins, accompanied by a few marabouts.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were now in the midst of high mountains covered with gum trees,
    beeches, ilexes, and junipers, which by their size and number clearly
    proved that it was very long since the Arabs inhabited this country;
    for they soon destroy all the trees within their reach, partly by the
    quantity of wood which they use both for cooking and for the bonfires
    which they burn all night to keep off the wild beasts and to warm the
    sentinels, and partly by their custom of clearing a path through the
    forest by setting fire to the trees as they stand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several Moors from Mascara arrived on the same day as ourselves, with
    fifty asses carrying baskets, pickaxes, shovels, and all kinds of
    implements for building, and as soon as the Sultan returned to the
    camp, he dispatched all the muleteers and some of his negroes to clear
    the ground on which the ancient Casabah of Tekedemta had stood. On the
    following day he sent a number of soldiers to go on with the clearing
    and to build a redoubt.
  </p>

  <p>
    All these workmen were unpaid, and ill-will and discontent soon
    appeared among them, they went grumbling to their work, and the Sultan
    was forced to superintend them in person, or nothing was done.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 26th an Arab courier brought Abd-el-Kader a letter from the
    prisoners who had been taken at Trara-Sickak by General Bugeaud and
    conveyed to France. The contents of the letter produced a great
    sensation, and joy was painted on every face. The Sultan sent for me,
    and said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> “I have received a letter from my Arabs at Marseilles; the
    Christians treat them kindly.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “How then,” said I, “can a Sultan so great and holy as thou suffer us
    to be treated so ill? The nights are cold among these mountains, and
    whilst thy Arabs at Marseilles sleep on good mattresses, wrapped in
    warm blankets, we have not even a rug to lie upon at night.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader smiled graciously, and sent for Ben Faka, whom he
    commanded to give us whatever we asked for, and first of all a rug to
    sleep on at night.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the 29th I begged the Sultan to allow Meurice and
    myself to go and see the ruins of Tekedemta, and the works carried on
    there by his troops. He told us to go without fear, and ordered one of
    his negroes to accompany us. We accordingly started, and after walking
    for half an hour we reached the ruins of Tekedemta. The ground on
    which the city stood is very broken and without a trace of vegetation;
    part of the wall of a fort was still standing, it was about ten feet
    thick at the base, and a few feet from the ground it fell back to
    the thickness of about seven feet. The wall was defended by nine
    towers, the foundations of which were still to be seen: they were
    without the line of the wall, but joined to it. The whole enclosure
    is one thousand eight hundred feet long, by one thousand one hundred
    and fifty feet broad. The remains within the fort prove that it was
    filled with streets, shops, and houses. On a hill a few hundred yards
    from the citadel, may be traced the foundation of the ancient Casabah
    or Bey’s palace, surrounded by fortifications: on these foundations
    Abd-el-Kader is going to build a new one. At the foot of the hill,
    about ten minutes’ walk from these ruins, flows the Ouet Mina. The
    site of the town is commanded by lofty mountains on every side, except
    towards the west, where a gentle ascent leads up to it. A road runs
    from hence to Mascara.
  </p>

  <p>
    After examining the ruins, we went towards a redoubt which
    Abd-el-Kader was constructing at a distance of two hundred yards to
    the eastward of the Casabah, and there we found the Sultan with his
    Chief Secretary, Ben Abu, and Milud-Ben-Arrach, reclining on the
    earth, which had been thrown up in digging a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> ditch. There was nothing
    in his costume to distinguish him from the common labourers: he wore a
    huge hat plaited of the leaves of the dwarf palm tree, with brims full
    three feet in circumference fastened with a worsted cord and tassels
    to the crown, which was at least a foot and a half high and pointed at
    the top.
  </p>

  <p>
    He greeted us kindly, and motioned us to sit beside him: encouraged by
    this gracious reception I ventured to ask him what were his projects
    in rebuilding Tekedemta.
  </p>

  <p>
    “My predecessors, who dwelt in this city,” replied he, “ruled from
    Tunis to Morocco, and I will restore it to its ancient splendour;
    I will gather together the tribes in this place, where we shall be
    secure from the attacks of the French, and when all my forces are
    collected I will descend from this steep rock like a vulture from his
    nest, and drive the Christians out of Algiers, Oran and Bona: if,
    indeed, you were content with those three cities I would suffer you
    to remain there, for the sea is not mine and I have no ships; but you
    want our plains and our inland cities and our mountains; nay, you even
    covet our horses, our tents, our camels, and our women, and you leave
    your own country to come and take that in which Mahomed has placed his
    people. But your Sultan is not a saint and a horseman as I am, and
    your horses will stumble and fall on our mountains, for they are not
    sure-footed like our horses, and your soldiers will die of sickness,
    and those whom the pestilence has spared will fall by the bullets of
    the Arab horsemen, for you are dogs who never pray to God.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I made no reply to this pompous harangue, but went to look at the
    works. The men were digging a ditch to enclose an area of about fifty
    square yards: they carried the earth which they dug out towards the
    spot on which the redoubt was to stand, as we do in throwing up
    blockhouses. This fort was intended to receive a garrison for the
    protection of the workmen. It stands on a slope and is commanded by
    the ruins of the ancient citadel and by a hill, so that even without
    cannon the garrison might easily be forced to evacuate.
  </p>

  <p>
    After taking a cursory view of these works, we returned to the
    ruins of the citadel, still accompanied by the negro, who could not
    understand what pleasure we could find in walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> about among old
    stones, and who kept muttering that we were “dogs” and “asses” all the
    time that we were exploring.
  </p>

  <p>
    At sunset we returned to the camp, where we heard a great uproar, and
    soon discovered a crowd of Arabs fighting and struggling in the midst
    of a dense cloud of dust: they were all rolling on the ground and
    wrestling together, screaming, swearing, and abusing each other, while
    the chaous were showering blows to the right and to the left upon them.
  </p>

  <p>
    We hastened to our tent somewhat alarmed at the scuffle, and on asking
    the cause of it, we heard that the chaous had been distributing barley
    among the horsemen, and that a few measures had been left over: the
    Arabs instantly rushed upon them, and in their efforts to seize a few
    handfuls of barley they made the riot we had seen.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was sitting in the tent waiting for supper, when one of
    Abd-el-Kader’s cousins, a marabout, hastily entered. “I am sent by the
    Sultan,” said he, “to ask whether thou wilt embrace the true faith and
    remain among us, and to tell thee that if thou wilt, he will make thee
    as powerful as himself.”
  </p>

  <p>I replied, that I wished to return to my own people.</p>

  <p>
    “Thou shalt have women, horses, arms, and plenty of powder, and thou
    shalt be as rich, as great, and as powerful as the Sultan himself.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “If,” said I, “the Sultan will give me the command of a ship I will
    become a Mahomedan, and I will go to the coast of Cherchell to fish
    for coral with the Italian prisoners, and we will enrich the Sultan.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I suppose the marabout guessed where I should really go if my
    conditions were accepted, for he left the tent without saying another
    word.
  </p>

  <p>
    While we were at the ruins, the tribes who dwelt at half a day’s
    march from Tekedemta had brought kuskussu and a roasted sheep, and
    the people of Milianah, all kinds of fruit. Ben Faka regaled us
    sumptuously with white bread, fruit, and a roast leg of mutton. The
    white loaves were brought to the camp every day by the tribes, and
    were the only pay given to Abd-el-Kader’s workmen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as I was ending my splendid repast, Ben Faka came to me with
    Abd-el-Kader’s command to go his tent. I hastened to obey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> the
    summons, full of the hope of liberty. The Sultan received me as usual,
    with enquiries after my health, after which he commanded me to write
    to General Rapatel, and to ask him whether he would give in exchange
    for me three of the Arab prisoners at Marseilles, to be selected by
    Abd-el-Kader. I refused to write unless the Sultan would at the same
    time name a ransom for my fellow-prisoners, and for Lanternier and
    the four women at Droma. After a very long discussion he agreed to
    exchange Meurice, the three Italians and myself, against twenty Arabs,
    but he refused to give up the women at all, and as I knew that poor
    Lanternier would not thank me for separating him from his wife and
    daughter I did not mention him in my letter to the General. When I
    had finished it the Sultan asked me whether I would not write to my
    family, and perceiving my hesitation, he assured me that I might write
    without fear for that no one should read my letter. I accordingly put
    both letters into the same cover, sealed them with a huge seal, and
    saw the Sultan give them to a man from Milianah, with orders to take
    them straight to Algiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I returned to the tent in high spirits to tell Meurice what I had
    done; the poor fellow laughed, wept, and thanked me all at once: we
    talked of our country and of our friends, and promised to stand by
    each other in good as well as in evil fortune, for we already looked
    upon our deliverance as certain. We were about to lie down to sleep,
    full of these delightful thoughts, when we found that our rug was
    gone. I should have complained to Abd-el-Kader, but he was at his
    prayers, so we were forced to stretch ourselves on the bare ground.
    The cold was piercing, and in the middle of the night a violent storm
    came on, so that before morning we were soaked to the skin.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 29th, Abd-el-Kader sent Milud-Ben-Arrach with the cavalry
    towards Mostaganem to reconnoitre, and gave us leave to revisit the
    ruins of Tekedemta. Some of the workmen were carting stones to build
    the Casabah, others preparing clay to serve as mortar, and others
    again finishing the redoubt. The neighbouring tribes came every day
    with provisions and oxen laden with wood, and a party of Moors was
    sent to burn lime at the nearest spot at which it could be found,
    about half a day’s journey from Tekedemta. At about a hundred and
    fifty paces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> to the east of the Casabah, some soldiers were busied
    in clearing a very large old vaulted cistern, which Abd-el-Kader
    has since turned into a general ammunition store; in order to avert
    suspicion, he has bricked up the door and built a sort of guardroom
    on the top. The tools were all very bad, with the exception of a few
    picks and shovels that had been stolen from us. The ditch varied
    in breadth and depth, and the slopes were uneven; and although the
    redoubt stood on a declivity, there was no opening to carry off the
    water; the earth was only bound together with branches of gum tree and
    oleander, and as the winters are very severe in these mountains it is
    more than probable that by this time the rain has washed the slopes
    into the ditch and that the Sultan’s redoubt is reduced to a heap of
    mud.
  </p>

  <p>
    We saw the three Italians at work here, upon which I expostulated
    with the Sultan, and represented to him that they were sailors and
    not labourers, and that moreover he was not at war with the nation
    to which they belonged; but he replied that they must earn their
    food, and that he was at war with every nation, for that as he had
    no seaports their friendship was useless to him, and that he was the
    greatest and most powerful of all Sultans, and feared no one.
  </p>

  <p>
    On returning to the camp we found that a party of tumblers had arrived
    there and were performing for the amusement of the soldiers, who
    watched them with great attention. But we had other diversions besides
    this; every evening an Arab crouching in front of Abd-el-Kader’s tent,
    sang for hour after hour. I never could catch all the words, but the
    following phrases were constantly repeated to a monotonous tune—
  </p>

  <p>“The Sultan is great, but Mahomed is yet greater.”</p>

  <p>“The Sultan is very great, he is generous, brave, and holy.”</p>

  <p>“The marabouts of Mecca are very great and holy.”</p>

  <p>
    “The Sultan has fine horses; the Sultan has many horses, and they are
    all excellent.”
  </p>

  <p>“The Sultan has immense treasures and much powder.”</p>

  <p>
    “The Arabs have fruitful plains; they have mountains covered with
    trees, and many rivers flow from them.”
  </p>

  <p>“We have beautiful women.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

  <p>“Our horses are fleet: no other horses can keep up with them.”</p>

  <p>“Our camels are very strong; we have great herds of cattle and sheep.”</p>

  <p>“Our guns are very good.”</p>

  <p>“We have powder—plenty of powder.”</p>

  <p>“Let us pray that all Christian dogs may perish.”</p>

  <p>“Plenty of powder.”</p>

  <p>
    The soldiers flocked round the singer and listened with deep interest
    to this patriotic and religious hymn.
  </p>

  <p>
    A marabout, a friend of Ben Faka’s, came nearly every evening to our
    tent, and sang for hours in the same style; but his voice was so harsh
    and shrill, and the burden of his song so tedious, that one of our
    chief annoyances was the having our ears assailed for such a length of
    time by his deafening psalmody.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 2nd of October it froze even within the tents in this
    mountainous region, and there was no grass left for the camels near
    Tekedemta; accordingly the Sultan sent them to the table land to the
    southward where there was excellent pasture. These mountains abound
    in game of every kind, which the soldiers caught and ate unknown to
    Abd-el-Kader. The market established by the Sultan at Tekedemta is
    well supplied with game, and with fish from the Ouet Mina which is
    full of them, and of a sort of tortoise which lives in the mud and
    is equally disagreeable to the taste and the smell, whereas the land
    tortoises, which are nearly as numerous, are delicious when properly
    cooked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader carried on the works at the redoubt with great ardour;
    fifty workmen were constantly employed upon them. To celebrate the
    inauguration of the new Tekedemta, the Sultan had the cannon brought
    to the redoubt, where it was loaded with stones and fired off three
    times, but so unskilfully that the stones flew into the midst of the
    camp to the great peril both of man and beast. At each discharge the
    marabouts and the workmen cried out “The Sultan is great!”
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader has since sent seven cannons from Mascara to Tekedemta:
    they were old Spanish six and eight pounders, which had all been
    spiked, and were mounted on very bad carriages of Arab manufacture.
    Fifteen or twenty families have emigrated from Mascara to Tekedemta,
    at the Sultan’s command: but it will not be easy to induce the whole
    population of Mascara to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> leave their habitations and to settle in a
    cold, unhealthy spot to which all provisions must be fetched on mules
    from the distance of a day’s journey, and where they consequently are
    very dear. Abd-el-Kader hopes to breathe new life into these remains
    of past greatness and splendor, but the descendants of the men who
    founded and built this city are unable to tell the prisoner or the
    traveller so much as the very name of the Sultans who had their
    capital in these mountains.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">On</span> the 30th of September, at sunrise, Abd-el-Kader gave the signal of
    departure. After a march of two hours we reached a desert country; the
    road was extremely bad, and frequently broken by ravines. To our left
    ran a long chain of wooded mountains, which we had not yet left behind
    us, when Ben Faka ordered a halt, and pitched the camp on the banks of
    the Ouet Mina.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next day, the 1st of October, whilst I was watching the negroes
    who were taking down the Sultan’s tent and loading it on the mules,
    I saw Ben Faka with three haicks under his arm, followed by three
    Italian prisoners. I went towards them and asked whither they were
    going, but before they had time to answer me Ben Faka, in a voice
    broken by rage, commanded me to leave them, and to mount my mule. I
    was struck with a sinister presentiment as to the fate of the three
    unhappy prisoners. From afar I saw Ben Faka give them the haicks, of
    which they had long stood in need, as they had nothing to wear but
    their ragged shirts. My three companions in misfortune then took the
    road to Tekedemta. The Sultan sent them to the works there, and it was
    only by his especial orders that Ben Faka had given them the haicks.
    At Tekedemta the poor fellows were exposed to every kind of privation
    and ill usage; one of them sunk under it. The two survivors afterwards
    gave me an account of their sufferings, which would appear incredible
    to any one who did not know the Arabs as well as I do. This separation
    was most painful to me; we had endured together hunger, cold, insults,
    and blows; we had talked together of our sorrows, our hopes, and our
    hatred of the Arabs.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

  <p>
    We started at daybreak, and marched eastward, still keeping the chain
    of mountains on our left. After a march of three hours, Ben Faka
    pitched the camp on the left bank of the Ouet Mina, upon a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i>
    covered with empty silos. Not a tent or even a single Arab was to be
    seen: the horsemen were obliged to ride for three or four hours in
    search of barley for their horses.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 4th of October we again struck our camp, and marched to within
    half a league of the wooded mountains I have mentioned above. Ben Faka
    pitched the camp on a small plain by the side of a stream which runs
    into the Ouet Mina. This plain is uncultivated, and in the winter
    it is so overflowed by the Ouet Mina as to look like a lake. It is
    covered with shrubs resembling the sweet briar, which bear a fruit
    like the medlar, only smaller, and containing a kernel. Like all the
    shrubs of this country, these swarm with large white snails and slugs
    enough to feed an army for some days. Next day we continued our march
    westward, bearing a few degrees to the north. We quitted the banks of
    the Ouet Mina, but the wooded mountain was still to our left.
  </p>

  <p>
    After six hours’ march we halted on a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i> covered with heaps of
    stones which looked like the ruins of a town: but Abd-el-Kader and his
    marabouts told us they had never heard of the existence of one on that
    spot.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 6th of October, after a march of two hours, the camp was
    pitched on a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plateau</i> at the eastern extremity of the plain of
    Mascara, at a place called Teknifil. Near it, on five hillocks, stand
    five marabouts. Here we heard that the French had sent an expedition
    from Oran, and that General Létang was marching on El-Borgj, a village
    two leagues to the north of Teknifil. Abd-el-Kader immediately went to
    El-Borgj with all his cavalry, and forced the inhabitants to abandon
    it. Next day the baggage, the flocks, the women, and children of the
    Borgia tribe were scattered about the plain, and orders were likewise
    sent to the inhabitants of Mascara, which is four leagues from
    Teknifil, to abandon the place. We stayed at Teknifil a fortnight,
    during which time Abd-el-Kader gathered together all the tribes that
    remained faithful to him, and when his army amounted to five or six
    thousand he followed the French to the plains of Macta. Every day
    couriers arrived at the camp with false news, either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> that the French
    were surrounded on all sides, or that they had been cut to pieces by
    the Sultan. The Arabs announced the news to us, and accompanied it by
    blows, abuse, and menaces of death. Moreover, we were half starved,
    and the hopes with which Abd-el-Kader’s kindness had inspired us were
    now turned into despair.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our days seemed long and gloomy: the Arabs maltreated us, and
    separated Meurice and me from the coral fishers. We had talked so
    long of our hopes, our home, and our families, that these subjects
    were quite worn out. At last, in order to pass the time, I set to
    work to make a chess board and a pack of cards. I stole a board from
    one of the powder chests (which it was my great amusement to water,
    at the risk of my life), and divided it into squares: I then cut some
    chess men out of branches of oleander: I also stole a few sheets of
    paper, for which Ben Faka beat me with a stick, and made a pack of
    cards of them. My knaves were jockeys with pipes in their mouths, and
    red, green, and white jackets; the queens were ladies dressed in the
    European fashion,—one with a bonnet, another with a foulard, another
    with hair dressed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la Chinoise</i>, and the fourth with long ringlets
    in the English style; the kings had huge crowns on their heads. Ben
    Faka and Ben Abu, who had the care of Abd-el-Kader’s tent during his
    absence, sent Meurice and me to guard it during great part of the day;
    for Christians and slaves as we were, they trusted us far more than
    the Arabs. The cushions and the sofa had been removed, and we were
    especially commanded to touch nothing in the tent, as the touch of a
    Christian would defile anything belonging to the Sultan. We lay on
    the carpet of this august and holy dwelling, and played at chess and
    picquet. The marabouts, in spite of their horror of any representation
    of the human face or figure, were struck with admiration at the
    accuracy with which I had copied the European costume in my knaves and
    queens. They were very anxious to understand the game of picquet, and
    overpowered us with questions about every card we played. Their cards
    are quite different to ours, and I have seen draughts in their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafés</i>
    but no chess boards, though one day when Abd-el-Kader saw me playing
    at chess with Meurice, he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> “My grandfather used sometimes to
    play with pieces like those on a draught board.”
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 20th of October, after a halt of fourteen days at the five
    marabouts, during which time we were exposed to threats, blows, and
    cruel privations, the tents were struck. A courier arrived at the
    camp, in the middle of the night, with the news that the French were
    marching towards Oran, and that the Sultan would be at Mascara on the
    morning of the 21st. In spite of the lateness of the hour (it was
    midnight) Ben Faka ordered the troops and the baggage to set out.
    There was a thick fog, and we suffered cruelly from the cold and damp,
    which I am sure laid the seeds of the illness under which poor Meurice
    finally sank. Meurice and I were mounted on the mules which carried
    the Sultan’s coffers. Each quarter of an hour we heard the voice of
    Ben Faka calling through the darkness, “France! Meurice! are you on
    your mules?” “Yes.” “Don’t get down, and above all don’t change with
    any of the horsemen.” “Never fear.” Ben Faka’s uneasiness was not
    without cause: he was responsible for any disorder that might happen
    during the march, and he was always afraid that if we quitted our
    mules the soldiers of the escort would pillage the Sultan’s treasure;
    for dogs and Christians as we were, Ben Faka knew that we were more
    trustworthy than the proud Arab warriors. With the first rays of the
    sun, we arrived with all the treasure safe at the pretty town of
    Mascara.
  </p>

  <p>
    The camp was pitched at the foot of the mountain which bounds the
    plain of Mascara on the north. A little stream, whose banks were
    covered with oleanders, ran through the midst of it. Mascara stands in
    the centre of a mountain gorge, on a steep and precipitous hill; the
    white and cheerful-looking houses are surrounded by a perfect grove of
    fig trees, and a few graceful poplars and slender minarets rise like
    lances among them. The view was so charming that I stole a sheet of
    paper and went outside the camp to sketch it. But I had scarce begun,
    when a mounted chaous rode up to me and gave me a blow with his stick.
    To avoid a repetition of it, I ran back to the tent with my unfinished
    sketch.
  </p>

  <p>
    A courier brought the news of Abd-el-Kader’s arrival at the camp, and
    the infantry instantly armed and went about ten minutes’ march towards
    Mascara, where it drew up in two lines. Presently the cavalry arrived
    at full gallop, and was drawn up by Muftar in two bodies behind the
    infantry. As soon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> Abd-el-Kader had passed them, the last soldiers,
    both horse and foot, quitted the line, and ran to place themselves in
    two rows before his tent. As he entered it, three discharges of cannon
    from Mascara announced the Sultan’s return to the neighbouring tribes.
    The soldiers kept up a constant firing in honour of the great victory
    which the Sultan had gained over the French.
  </p>

  <p>
    All that day the camp was in a state of great confusion; horsemen
    belonging to the adjacent tribes were continually coming and going,
    and feeding their horses in the camp: this, added to the cries of
    joy and exultation, and the incessant galloping and firing of the
    soldiers, produced an indescribable tumult and clamour.
  </p>

  <p>
    At sunset Abd-el-Kader mounted his horse, accompanied by a few
    marabouts and the thirty negroes, and rode to his wife’s tent, which
    is pitched three or four miles to the south of Mascara, on a spot near
    which Abd-el-Kader has a garden and a marabout.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chiefs who accompany the Sultan also have tents for their wives
    and families at the same place, where there is a sort of female camp.
    That inhabited by Abd-el-Kader’s wife is woven of black camel hair.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sultan is said to be a most tender husband, and his conduct proves
    the truth of the report, for he has not a single concubine. His wife
    is very pretty; her tall slender figure is seen to great advantage
    under the graceful folds of her haick, which is girded round her
    middle with a red worsted cord. The Arabs usually like large fat
    women, but Abd-el-Kader’s taste is different. Though often absent from
    his wife for three or four months at a time, his attachment to her
    remains unchanged. Even from the banks of the Ouet Mina he frequently
    sent her presents of fruit, butter, honey, and other rarities. He
    has had one daughter by her; and though it was asserted that she
    was delivered of a boy on the very day on which the French entered
    Mascara, I do not believe it; for if Abd-el-Kader really had a son I
    am sure the Arabs would have told me so. During the night the thirty
    negroes keep watch round the tent that nothing may disturb the repose
    of Abd-el-Kader and his wife; and during their absence from the camp,
    a guard of foot soldiers supplies their place around the Sultan’s tent.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the middle of the night a man peeped cautiously out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
    Sultan’s tent, darted out, and tried to make his escape; but the
    sentinels who were not asleep seized him. It was Zaka, an old negro
    slave, and Abd-el-Kader’s cup-bearer. He had long been used to take
    advantage of the moments during which the Sultan left his tent to
    enter it and rob his treasure. The thirty negroes, either blinded
    by the confidence with which his high functions inspired him, or
    unwilling to denounce their comrade, had never stopped him, although
    they had frequently seen him leave the tent at undue hours, and during
    the absence of the Sultan. But the Arab soldiers were much less
    accommodating; and when Abd-el-Kader returned to the camp at sunrise
    they brought Zaka before him, together with several sultani (a silver
    coin) found on his person.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coffee-sellers deposed, that Zaka had for a long time been in
    the habit of spending a great deal of money in their booths, and of
    treating his friends there daily. Haicks, bernouses, yataghans, and
    splendid pistols were found in his tent; and every one knew that his
    means were small and uncertain. Abd-el-Kader ordered him to be put
    in irons for an unlimited time; and he was brought to our tent, and
    placed under the guard of his friend Ben Faka. As the punishment
    promised to last very long, the chaous struck a nail through the bar
    which joins the irons, instead of securing it with a padlock.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ben Faka was presently summoned to his duties in Abd-el-Kader’s tent;
    and after his departure Zaka crept to the further extremity of the
    tent, threw himself on the ground like a man overcome with fatigue,
    and pretended to sleep. Meurice watched all his movements with great
    attention, “The negro is trying to escape,” said he. “He is asleep,”
    I replied; “besides, both his feet are hampered.” “Say rather, he is
    pretending to sleep,” answered Meurice; “only watch his proceedings.”
    Zaka took down a rifle which he laid across two bales; he then pulled
    off his black bernouse, hung it over the gun, and crouched down
    behind it. I left the tent, and soon after saw him slowly cross the
    camp, wrapped in his white haick, and hiding his face. As soon as he
    had reached the limits of the camp he took to his heels, and soon
    disappeared among the fig trees on the mountain.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Ben Faka returned to the tent, and found that the prisoner for
    whom he was personally responsible had escaped, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> flew into a
    violent passion, and loaded us with blows and abuse, for not having
    prevented Zaka’s flight. A hundred horsemen mounted immediately,
    and rode in all directions in pursuit of him. Ben Faka was anxious
    to conceal the escape of Zaka from the Sultan, as he hoped that the
    fugitive would be retaken before the news of his flight could reach
    Abd-el-Kader. But the horsemen had not returned when a chaous summoned
    him into the presence of the Sultan. As Ben Faka was going towards
    the tent he met Zaka in the midst of an escort of horsemen, with his
    hands tied behind his back; he took possession of his prisoner, and
    went with him to the Sultan’s tent. Without further enquiry, the
    Sultan condemned Zaka to be put in irons for an indefinite time, and
    to receive six hundred blows a day with a stick, for three successive
    days; two hundred at seven in the morning, two hundred at noon, and
    two hundred at night; in all one thousand eight hundred blows in three
    days. Zaka was instantly brought before our tent, and laid flat upon
    his face; two of his friends held the skirts of his bernouse, while
    the chaous administered to him the first two hundred blows.
  </p>

  <p>
    The important post which Zaka had filled, joined to his munificence,
    had gained him many friends, to whose zeal he now entirely owed his
    life. He could not possibly have survived the one thousand eight
    hundred blows well laid on, but the chaous took care not to hit very
    hard, and the Arabs who held the skirts of his bernouse stretched them
    so tight, as considerably to deaden the force of the blows. When the
    chaous had administered the first two hundred, Zaka was brought into
    our tent, where his friends busied themselves in kneading and chafing
    his whole body, and in warming him; and Ben Faka, who now remembered
    nothing but his former friendship, loaded him with attentions and gave
    him coffee. By degrees Zaka recovered, but he was not released from
    his irons, and at the time of my departure he was still stretched
    upon the ground, vainly expecting each day the Sultan’s order for his
    release.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sultan administers justice in a very simple and expeditious
    manner. The contending parties are brought to his tent, where the
    accuser first makes his complaint; the witnesses, if there be any,
    are then examined, after which the accused makes his defence. Both
    accusation and defence, like all Arab ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>planations, are long-winded
    and clamorous. When the pleadings are at an end, the Sultan decides
    singly, and without appeal. Without saying a word, he condemns the
    guilty to any kind of punishment by signs to the chaous. He raises
    his hand, and the accused is carried to prison; he holds it out
    horizontally, and the accused is led beyond the limits of the camp,
    and his head is cut off by the chaous; he bends his hand towards the
    earth, and the accused is dragged away and bound, laid flat upon the
    earth, and beaten with a stick. The Sultan usually determines the
    number of blows; if he omits to do so, it is left to the discretion of
    the chaous.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of the complaints and accusations are of thefts, a crime
    exceedingly common among the Arabs, and generally treated with great
    leniency, especially by Abd-el-Kader, who is neither cruel nor
    vindictive.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">One</span> evening at sunset, when Meurice and I returned to our tent, after
    spending the day in a garden near the camp, Ben Faka told me that
    the Sultan desired to see me. I went to his tent, where he gave me
    two letters, one for Meurice and the other from General Rapatel for
    myself. I opened the latter, and informed the Sultan of its contents,
    which were to this effect: General Rapatel offered Abd-el-Kader the
    choice of ten Arab prisoners, in exchange for the six Frenchmen and
    Italians, and ten others in exchange for Mahomed Ben Hussein, the
    ex-Bey of Medeah; adding, that the European prisoners might be sent
    at once to some French town, and that Abd-el-Kader should receive
    the Arabs in exchange for them immediately upon their return from
    Marseilles.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this sentence Abd-el-Kader smiled, and said “You shall go as soon
    as my Arabs arrive at the camp.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bey of Medeah, who was our ally, had been taken prisoner by the
    Bey of Milianah, loaded with chains, and thrown into the dungeons of
    Ouchda, a town on the frontier of Morocco, where he still languishes,
    exposed to the most cruel treatment, and in constant danger of being
    starved to death by his inhuman gaolers.
  </p>

  <p>
    After consulting the marabouts who surrounded him, Abd-el-Kader
    ordered me to write word, that he demanded twenty prisoners in
    exchange for the six Europeans, and that he would give up the Bey of
    Medeah in exchange for all the prisoners at Marseilles. I remonstrated
    with him on the unreasonableness of his terms, and suggested that he
    should split the difference, and take fifteen Arabs as ransom for
    us. To this he agreed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> I wrote to the General and to my family.
    As I was sealing the letters, Abd-el-Kader said, that he hoped I had
    written all that I wished to say; and that I should not be deterred
    by fear of his displeasure from writing anything that I saw, or from
    expressing any opinion upon his manner of treating his prisoners;
    “For,” said he, “a Sultan so great and holy as I fears no one upon
    earth.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I hastened to take Meurice his wife’s letter, and to inform him of the
    favourable dispositions of Abd-el-Kader; and I had the satisfaction
    of seeing him fall asleep with a smile on his face. I crept close to
    him to warm his frozen limbs; but the night was so cold, that in the
    morning when we wanted to rise Meurice’s legs were benumbed, and he
    was forced to lie upon the ground. All his blood had rushed to his
    head, which caused him the most violent pain. At about eleven o’clock
    I carried him out into the sunshine, in hopes that the warmth might do
    him good.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 28th of October Abd-el-Kader received a letter from Morocco,
    announcing the death of the King of France. I believe that the Emperor
    of Morocco meant Charles X., but Abd-el-Kader thought it was Louis
    Philippe, and immediately spread a report that the King of the French
    had been assassinated, that a civil war had broken out in France, and
    that all the troops stationed at Algiers were about to be recalled.
  </p>

  <p>
    This news excited universal joy; the troops prepared to celebrate
    the retreat of the French in a manner worthy of the greatness of the
    occasion, and three whole days were spent in festivities, both at
    Mascara and in the camp. These consisted chiefly in sham fights, in
    which the first division of cavalry, dressed in bluejackets and red
    trowsers, and without haicks or bernouses, represented the French, and
    were headed by Abd-el-Kader; the second, with their flowing haicks
    and bernouses, were the Arabs. The two troops were drawn up at a
    considerable distance from each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abd-el-Kader first detached ten of his French corps as skirmishers,
    who were met by the same number of the opposite party. The assailants
    on both sides started at a foot’s pace, and by degrees urged on their
    horses to a gallop. When they were within five-and-twenty paces of
    each other, they shouted “Ah! ah! ah!” fired off their rifles, waved
    their haicks and bernouses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> drew their sabres, and acted a fight hand
    to hand. Ten more horsemen were then detached from each troop, and
    galloped into the midst of the mêlée, whereupon the first two bands
    retreated to their respective posts, while the others continued the
    fight. Sometimes the forty horsemen kept up the struggle, until the
    arrival of fresh auxiliaries on one side turned the chances against
    the other, who then retreated at full gallop, brandishing their
    sabres, firing off their rifles, and uttering loud cries. Then a
    pursuit was acted, till both parties had galloped enough, and returned
    to their stations. At one moment the confusion became excessive; the
    mêlée was thick and violent, bernouses fluttered, sabres flashed, and
    a cloud of dust concealed the combatants, whose fierce wild shouts
    rung in our ears. Suddenly the drums on both sides beat the recall,
    and the chiefs restored order; the horsemen gave a few moments of
    rest to their horses, and then the racing and struggling, the strange
    evolutions and single combats began again with as much vehemence as
    ever.
  </p>

  <p>
    This military spectacle invariably terminates with the defeat of
    the French. When Abd-el-Kader thinks it time to put an end to the
    exercises, he plunges into the thick of the mêlée; two Arabs then
    seize his horse by the bridle, one on each side, and lead the Sultan
    away captive to his tent, amid shouts of triumph and enthusiasm.
    Abd-el-Kader, casting around him proud glances on his followers wrapt
    in admiration of his warlike grace, makes his horse prance and rear
    till it stands upright, while the Sultan smiles complacently, as much
    as to say “Am not I a horseman indeed?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “And so you are, my fine Sultan,” said I to myself; “but you would not
    be quite so cock-a-hoop on an English saddle, for all that.”
  </p>

  <p>
    On the third and last day of this warlike exhibition Ben Faka came
    to me with a swaggering air and said, “There has been a battle at
    Tlemsen; the Kalifah has beaten the French, and taken a great number
    of prisoners, whom he is going to send to the Sultan, so you will soon
    have plenty of companions.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I believe,” said I, “that you are as much deceived now as you were
    when you told me that Ahmed Bey had taken Bona.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, poor Meurice got worse every day, and I spent most of my
    time in rubbing his aching limbs, and in endeavouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> to warm his
    frozen legs and feet against my breast, and to relieve the burning
    pain in his head, by wetting my hands, and then laying them on his
    forehead. I was thus occupied when Ben Faka returned to the tent, and
    said to me with an insulting laugh, “Come and look at the Christian
    prisoners whom the Kalifah took at Tlemsen, and has sent to the
    Sultan.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I left the tent without answering Ben Faka, and saw two unfortunate
    soldiers, half naked, barefooted, and in a state of indescribable
    wretchedness, whom the chaous were driving along with their sticks,
    just as a butcher goads the tired beasts to the slaughter-house. They
    halted before the Sultan’s tent, and I attempted to approach, in order
    to question them, but was immediately driven away by the chaous.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went back to Meurice, and was telling him what had passed when
    Ben Faka brought the two new prisoners into our tent, and gave each
    of them a haick. I beckoned them to draw near, and asked them their
    names, the regiments to which they belonged, and where they came from.
  </p>

  <p>
    “My name is Bourgeois,” replied the first; “I am an old soldier in the
    eleventh, and my comrade Fleury is an ex-soldier of the sixty-sixth;
    we both belong to the battalion at Tlemsen.”
  </p>

  <p>“Has there been a fight there then?” said I.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

  <p>
    “None whatever, Sir. I will tell you how it was. The Bedouins had
    pressed hard upon the town for some time, and no provisions could be
    brought to market, and so you see the garrison was put upon short
    commons. One’s appetite grows with eating, they say; but I assure you
    it grows much faster with an empty stomach; and one morning, when
    Fleury and I were more sharp set than usual, we bethought ourselves
    that we would go and forage like the Bedouins. There were plenty of
    fruit trees outside the town, and so, without more ado, we went out
    to make a meal off them. After eating our fill, we were going back to
    the town again; but we had reckoned without our host. The Bedouins
    caught us like larks in a snare; and not content with having taken
    us prisoners, they have given us the strappado the whole way. They
    say, to be sure, that Abd-el-Kader has given orders to take as many
    prisoners as possible, and not to cut their heads off, and I suppose
    that is the only reason why ours are still upon our shoulders; but
    they have treated us brutally. However, now that we are come to
    Abd-el-Kader’s royal palace, as you may say, I hope we shall not be
    quite so ill-used. But, Lieutenant, if you write to the Governor
    please don’t forget just to speak a word for Bourgeois and Fleury, for
    these quarters are not at all to our liking.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I assured my fellow-sufferers that I would not forget them; and that
    very evening, with Abd-el-Kader’s permission, I wrote to inform
    General Rapatel of their arrival, and to ask for six Arab prisoners in
    exchange for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our new companions fully sympathised in my anxiety about Meurice’s
    health, and forgot their own sufferings to assist me in nursing him.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the next morning Ben Faka, in the same conceited and scornful tone
    in which he had announced the arrival of the prisoners from Tlemsen,
    informed me that another prisoner was being brought before the Sultan.
  </p>

  <p>
    We went outside the tent, where we saw a French prisoner led past us.
    He was about fifty years of age; a long beard and thick moustache of
    a light colour hung dirty and matted over his naked breast; a ragged
    shirt covered his shoulders, which, with a pair of soldiers trowser’s
    full of holes, and a grey hat all crushed and battered, completed
    his costume. The blood which dropped from the wounds on his feet and
    legs marked his path. A noisy and cruel escort of children, which
    had followed him from the outskirts of the town, never ceased from
    tormenting him with blows, or with throwing stones: clotted black
    gore dropped from several deep cuts in his head. I endeavoured to get
    near him, for Meurice, whom we had brought out in front of the tent,
    had recognised M. Lanternier, but the chaous drove me back with their
    sticks, and the prisoner was hurried past us, and dragged before
    Abd-el-Kader, amid the acclamations of the crowd.
  </p>

    At the sight of this unhappy man Abd-el-Kader was touched with pity,
    and ordered Ben Faka to give him a haick and a pair of slippers,
    and to conduct him to our tent. But the chaous who had escorted him
    exclaimed, that the Christian dog had refused to obey their orders,
    and that he ought therefore to be sent to prison. In vain did the
    unhappy man implore Abd-el-Kader’s mercy, and lament his separation
    from his wife and daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> in the most heart-rending words.
    Abd-el-Kader, unmoved by his anguish, commanded the chaous to take
    him to the prison at Mascara, but to keep him separate from the Arab
    prisoners, who might otherwise ill-use him.
  </p>

  <p>
    The unfortunate man was about to renew his entreaties for mercy, but
    his mouth was stopped by a blow. He passed before our tent, but we
    were not allowed to address to him a single word of consolation. As
    he passed us his eyes filled with tears, and anguish and despair were
    painted in his countenance. He slackened his pace for a moment to look
    at us; but the chaous beat him, and the children attacked him with
    abuse and with stones, one of which made a deep wound in his head—the
    blood gushed forth in a torrent, and the poor victim staggered; but
    his pitiless tormentors drove him on before them. I withdrew into the
    tent to hide my tears, and was soon followed by the other prisoners:
    we all wept together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meurice’s state became more alarming every day. Bourgeois and Fleury
    chafed his limbs, and laid rags soaked in cold water upon his burning
    temples, whilst I went to the tent of Ben Faka’s coffee-maker, where I
    heated his slippers and some of his rags, which I placed upon his legs
    and feet while still hot. With inconceivable difficulty we made him
    some barley-water, but he drank it with disgust, because it was not
    sweetened. He wished to go to Mascara, to take a vapour bath, which he
    fancied would cure him; and I accordingly obtained an interview with
    Abd-el-Kader, and asked his permission to allow me to accompany him
    thither, which he granted for the next day. I then asked him for some
    sugar for Meurice, which he immediately ordered Ben Faka to give me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next morning Abd-el-Kader lent us one of his baggage mules and a negro
    called Hassan, to take Meurice to Mascara. I led the mule by the
    bridle, and Hassan got up behind the sick man, and supported him in
    his arms. We were also accompanied by the army surgeon, called Tussis,
    who had studied medicine at Tunis, though not to much purpose, for he
    was extremely ignorant.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went into the bath with Meurice, and undressed him, for he was
    unable to move. I had intended to take a bath myself, but the dirt
    and stench of the place made it impossible to me. I then went to the
    Kait of Mascara, and asked leave to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> M. Lanternier, which the Kait
    refused. On hearing my disappointment, Hassan told me that he would go
    and find out his prison, and conduct me to it. I returned to Meurice
    in the meantime, and found him in a state of perfect despair, as the
    Arabs had refused to shampoo him, for fear of defiling themselves by
    touching a Christian. Fortunately Jean Mardulin, a French deserter,
    came to his assistance, and shampooed him as well as he was able:
    he then dressed him, and wrapped him in two or three rugs, which
    the Sultan had given him for the purpose. Meanwhile I went to fetch
    Tussis, who was to bleed the sick man; but Tussis referred me to a
    barber, who spoke pretty good Spanish. When I had explained to him
    what I wanted, he took his basin and razor, a glass, fire, and paper,
    and followed us to the baths. He first shaved the back of Meurice’s
    head, made several incisions in it with the razor, and then covered it
    with a glass, under which he placed several pieces of lighted paper.
    The blood flowed freely, and Meurice found himself somewhat relieved.
    Tussis watched his proceedings with great attention, and seemed to
    me to be taking a lesson in practical surgery, whilst he affected to
    consider the operation of too little importance for the exercise of
    his own skill.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were now ordered to leave the bath, as the time appropriated to the
    women was come. Mardulin and I wrapped Meurice in the rugs from head
    to foot, and carried him to the hospital, where we left him to sleep
    till it was time to return to the camp. I had been very hot in the
    bath, and on leaving it I felt a chill. As soon as Meurice was asleep
    I went out into the public square, and laid myself upon the ground in
    the sun. Before long I saw Hassan, who beckoned to me mysteriously to
    follow him. We crossed the square, and stopped before a house, the
    door of which was open. “That,” said he, “is Lanternier’s prison; but
    take care you are not caught, or you will be beaten.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I have already said, that the door of the house was open; within it
    was an iron grating. At the distance of about two feet (<em>i. e.</em> the
    thickness of the wall) was another door, with a second iron grating,
    within which were crowded the Arab prisoners with no air or light but
    what the grating admitted. Between the two gratings, like a wild beast
    in a cage, was Lan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>ternier, crouching on the ground, covered with
    rags, pale and emaciated. The dirt and disorder in his person, and the
    expression of stupid despondency in his countenance, showed what he
    must have endured. His eyes glared with a sort of feverish brightness.
  </p>

  <p>
    I drew near, and told him who I was. He described to me his
    misfortunes, the sufferings of his wife and daughter, the ill-usage he
    had received from the chaous. He said that his prison was horrible;
    that it was only cleaned once a week; and that at night, when the
    outer door was shut, he was almost suffocated by the stench of the
    inner room, from which he was only separated by the grating; that
    he received no food but a bit of barley cake in the morning, and a
    handful of boiled barley at night; and that he must have died of
    hunger, but for the kindness of Mardulin, who brought him a bit of
    white bread and some snuff every morning. He implored me to intercede
    for him with Abd-el-Kader, that he might be allowed to go to the camp
    to the other Christian prisoners.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sentinel now began to look at me suspiciously, and I departed,
    overwhelmed with grief. My mental sufferings, combined with the chill
    which had seized me on coming out of the bath made me ill, and I
    followed the mule, on which Hassan had placed Meurice, with tottering
    steps. When I awoke next morning, I was as ill as Meurice; my legs
    were frozen, my head ached violently, and I was unable to stand.
    Bourgeois was indefatigable in rendering every assistance in his power
    to both of us.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 2nd of November some Arabs brought from Mascara three of the
    frames upon which are stretched the haicks which hide the Moorish
    women when they travel in panniers on the backs of mules. We heard
    that these were intended to conceal Lanternier’s wife and daughter and
    the two German women, whom Abd-el-Kader was going to send as a present
    to Muley Abd-el-Rachman, Emperor of Morocco. These three frames were
    each balanced by chests, destined to contain five wild beasts, which,
    together with the women, some ostriches, and some carpets, constituted
    the Sultan’s present to the Emperor.
  </p>

  <p>
    One morning, when Abd-el-Kader returned from his wife’s tent, which he
    visited every night, he brought back with him Benedicto, the little
    Italian sailor-boy, who had been living among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> the women for several
    months. The poor child was very beautiful, and remarkably intelligent.
    The Arab women had been very kind to him, in spite of which he had
    been left without any other covering than the shirt he wore when taken
    prisoner. He had entirely forgotten his mother and his country, and
    already spoke Arabic better than Italian. When we asked him where his
    mother was, he pointed to the women’s tents; if we enquired what was
    his religion, he said he was a Mahomedan; he recited the Mahomedan
    prayer perfectly; and the Arab soldiers, who petted him very much,
    often made him repeat it fifteen or twenty times in succession.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had heard that the Sultan intended to remove his camp on the 26th
    to the neighbourhood of Tlemsen, I therefore asked leave to speak to
    him, and, on obtaining it, was carried into his presence. I again
    besought him to send Meurice to Oran, and assured him that if he did
    not, the unhappy man would be dead in a week. Abd-el-Kader replied
    with his usual smile, “If he is so ill as you say, the journey to
    Oran would kill him; but, instead of following my camp, you shall
    remain at Mascara, where you shall be lodged in a comfortable house
    till you can be exchanged.” He then ordered Ben Faka to give each of
    us a haick, and a little vest for the child. I returned to the tent
    overwhelmed with grief, and poor Meurice, who had flattered himself
    with the hopes of returning to Oran, read the cruel disappointment in
    my face, and began to bewail his misfortunes, and to inveigh against
    Abd-el-Kader’s barbarity. I tried to comfort him with the prospect of
    being sheltered, warmed, and fed at Mascara, and protected against the
    brutality of the Arabs; but he answered, “It is all too late!” hid his
    head under his haick, and lay on the ground stupified by misery.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">During</span> the afternoon of the 5th a mule was brought to convey Meurice
    to Mascara, and I asked for another for myself; but in spite of my
    illness it was refused me. I revenged myself by pouring several
    pitchers of water into the chests containing cartridges which stood in
    our tent; and I flatter myself that I watered them so thoroughly as to
    prevent their ever being of much use to my persecutors.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had no sooner accomplished my revenge than Ben Faka returned
    with the Kait of Mascara who was to escort us to the town, and we
    immediately started, accompanied by Fleury, Bourgeois, and little
    Benedicto. I was so overpowered by illness and fatigue that at length
    even the Kait took pity on me, and seeing that I was totally unable to
    walk, ordered Bourgeois and Fleury to lift me up on the mule behind
    Meurice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kait conducted us to a small house next door to that in which he
    administers justice, and informed us that this was to be our dwelling.
    It consisted of two small rooms on the ground floor, and one above
    which was accessible only by an external staircase in the court. We
    took up our quarters in the upper room, as it seemed rather less
    damp than the others. It was quite bare of any sort of furniture,
    and received a little light and a good deal of cold wind through two
    loop-holes looking into the court. A plank about three feet wide,
    fixed against the wall, seemed intended to serve as a bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kait gave us a piece of an old camel hair tent and two rugs to
    cover us. The two soldiers had the tent, and Meurice and I the rugs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sultan’s artillery was just passing through Mascara on its road
    to Tekedemta, and Jean Mardulin who belonged to it, came to visit us;
    he found us so ill and miserable that he proposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> stay and take
    care of us,—an offer which we accepted with joy and gratitude. He had
    scraped together a little money, which he generously placed at our
    disposal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meurice begged for an interview with Lanternier, but the Kait replied,
    that he had received strict orders from Abd-el-Kader not to allow him
    to communicate with the other prisoners. We, however, sent him a share
    of our rations every day by Mardulin.
  </p>

  <p>
    So far were we from recovering our health that I had now entirely lost
    the use of my legs, and my headaches daily increased in violence. I
    begged the Kait twenty times to let me be bled; and at length he sent
    me the same barber who had operated on Meurice. The barber cupped me
    on the back of my head, which relieved me very much.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the morning of the 12th the weather was detestable, the rain fell
    in torrents, and we suffered even more than usual from cold and damp.
    Meurice stretched out his hand towards me, as we lay side by side; I
    took it, and asked him how he felt. He replied that he was no better
    and felt very cold. I crept closer to him and offered him my haick;
    but he refused it, saying that he did not suffer more than the day
    before, but that he felt he had not long to live. “You,” said he, “are
    young and strong; you will return to Algiers, where you will see my
    wife—poor Clarisse! tell her how much I loved her, and that my last
    thought was of her.” He then covered his head with his haick, and for
    half an hour uttered not a single groan. At the end of that time I
    took hold of his arm and asked him how he felt: he made no answer, and
    I uncovered his face—he was dead.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will not attempt to describe the feelings which crowded upon me as
    I lay with Meurice’s body by my side. Night was come, and I called
    the other prisoners, and bade them examine whether our poor companion
    was really dead. They went to fetch the Kait, who, now that it was
    too late, ordered a fire for us. Had this been granted us a few
    days earlier, Meurice might have been saved. Bourgeois and Mardulin
    undressed the body, rolled it in a rug, and laid it in the opposite
    corner of the room. They gave me his clothes. The vermin on the haick
    were so thick that it stood on end; but misery by degrees blunts all
    our sensibilities, both moral and physical. I rolled myself in his
    clothes, and at least was warmer.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

  <p>
    The next afternoon Mardulin and Bourgeois, assisted by a couple of
    Jews, whom the Kait had appointed for the purpose, removed the body.
    They dug a hole just outside the wall of the town, on the road to El
    Borgj, sewed the body in a ragged piece of old haick, and buried it
    there.
  </p>

  <p>
    The weather that night was terrific; the rain fell in torrents, and
    the wind blew a perfect gale; nevertheless, at sunrise an Arab came
    to inform the Kait that the corpse of the Christian was half out of
    the earth. In spite of the weather the Arabs had dug up the body, in
    order to steal the ragged piece of haick in which Mardulin had sewn
    it. The Kait affected to be very angry, and promised us that he would
    punish the thieves; but he made no attempt to discover them. Mardulin
    immediately went to the spot where he had buried Meurice, enlarged
    the hole, and replaced in it our unfortunate companion, whom these
    barbarians would not suffer to rest in peace, even after death.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Abd-el-Kader heard of Meurice’s death, he sent the most positive
    orders that we were to have everything we might want; and the
    Kait asked me what I wished for. I asked for three fowls, and for
    permission for Lanternier to join us. As the Kait wished to keep me
    alive, I obtained both my requests. It is impossible to describe
    the joy of poor Lanternier, who immediately set about curing me by
    continued and violent friction and the application of red-hot bricks
    to my legs, which were so completely benumbed that even when the skin
    was burnt I did not feel it.
  </p>

  <p>
    All this time the Sultan was encamped to the south of Oran, at a place
    where there are several marabouts and some mineral springs. He had
    sent Milud-ben-Arrach with the cavalry to Milianah to collect tribute
    from the Hadjutes of the neighbouring tribes. He was to have gone
    among the Hadjutes himself during the month of September, but had been
    prevented by the revolt of the Beni-Flitas.
  </p>

  <p>
    I heard one day that a courier had arrived with letters from Algiers,
    which he had delivered to the Kait. I got Bourgeois and Mardulin to
    carry me to his house, though certainly nothing of less importance
    would have induced me to be thus dragged across the public place of
    Mascara. The Kait was touched with pity at my deplorable condition.
    He told me that the courier brought a letter from Algiers, which, no
    doubt, would effect my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> deliverance. I asked to see it, and my joy was
    inexpressible on beholding General Rapatel’s seal. Guess, then, what
    was my disappointment when the Kait told me that he dared not open
    it, but would send it at once to the Sultan, and that Fleury should
    accompany the courier in order to read it, as I was too weak and ill
    to bear the fatigue of the journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as the courier was about to start, four new prisoners arrived;
    these were Monsieur Pic a settler, his German servant formerly a
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasseur</i>, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">disciplinaire</i>, and Madame Laurent a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cantinière</i>.
    M. Pic’s servant, who had received a ball in his hip, was left at
    Mascara, while the Kait sent his three companions to the Sultan with
    the courier and Fleury. I especially charged the latter to ask the
    Sultan to exchange the four new prisoners against the four Arabs who
    were to have served as ransom for Meurice.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 18th thirty Beni-Amers,—men, women, and children, arrived at
    Mascara, loaded with chains. They had been taken on the road to Oran,
    whither they were going to place themselves under the protection of
    the French. Abd-el-Kader ordered the two chiefs to be hung as an
    example to others: the rest were thrown into prison.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fleury returned to Mascara with the other prisoners and a soldier
    called Devienne, who had been taken by the Arabs near Tlemsen. The
    Arabs who escorted them told them that they must take off the haicks
    which had been given to them by the Bey of Milianah, and appear before
    the Sultan in their Christian dresses. The prisoners obeyed, and the
    haicks disappeared.
  </p>

  <p>
    After questioning the prisoners, and rewarding the Arabs who had
    brought them, Abd-el-Kader gave each of them two bits of money,
    and bade them fear nothing. Fleury then read the letter in which
    the Governor agreed to give fifteen Arabs in exchange for the six
    Christians, and the Sultan promised to send us all to Algiers at once.
    He also sent his command to the Kait to clothe us all afresh with red
    trowsers and new haicks, which the latter executed as far as he was
    able, but the Sultan’s store contained but one piece of cloth, which
    was only sufficient for three pairs of trowsers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kait promised that we should set out for Algiers as soon as the
    two Italian prisoners, Crescenso and Francesco, had arrived from
    Tekedemta, whither he had already sent to fetch them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> That evening,
    when we were all assembled, I begged the four new prisoners to tell us
    how they had fallen into the hands of the Arabs.
  </p>

  <p>
    M. Pic and his servant were going towards Buffarik with a cartload of
    sand, when some Arabs rode towards them, crying “Run! run!” Thinking
    that the Arabs meant this as a friendly warning to them to escape
    from some impending danger, the servant took to his heels, and M. Pic
    was about to follow him when the Arabs fired at them, and wounded the
    servant in the hip. They then took the horse out of the cart, mounted
    their two prisoners upon it, and carried them to the Bey of Milianah.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">disciplinaire</i> was returning rather drunk, from a merry-making at
    a blockhouse near Buffarik, when he was surprised by some Arabs, who
    took him to their tribe near the Queen’s Tomb.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Madame Laurent, in company with Madame Lafôret another <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cantinière</i>,
    was going to Mahelma to see her husband, when they were seized and
    carried to the tents of the same tribe; where for two months they were
    subjected to every sort of horrible ill usage, under which they both
    fell sick, and Madame Lafôret soon perished.
  </p>

  <p>
    Madame Laurent got worse and worse, and at last her master sold her to
    another Arab, who kept her for two months, at the end of which time,
    finding her as ill as ever and utterly unable to work, he took her to
    the Bey of Milianah.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">disciplinaire</i> with whom she had never been allowed to have any
    communication, had also fallen sick and was carried to the Bey.
  </p>

  <p>
    On their arrival at Mascara, these prisoners were in the most abject
    state of misery and dirt. Fleury cut off Madame Laurent’s long hair
    which was covered with vermin, and she bought a comb with the money
    the Sultan had given her. The Kait lodged her with his women, but
    she soon returned to us in a rage, as the Arab women had struck and
    insulted her, and she was forced to take refuge from their malice with
    us.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our days were passed in the following manner. At daybreak Mardulin
    woke us, lighted the fire, and went to market to buy with his
    own savings figs, eggs, and white bread for us, and snuff for M.
    Lanternier. We then breakfasted; after which we cleaned the house
    by turns. When the weather was fine we went to sit upon the terrace
    of the Casabah, and hunted the vermin on our clothes: only M. Pic’s
    servant, whose wound did not heal, stayed within.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

  <p>
    One day, while I was discussing with Mardulin how to obtain from the
    French Government his pardon and permission to return—a favour he so
    well deserved for his devotion and kindness to us, we overheard the
    following conversation among the other prisoners. They were talking
    about their return to Algiers: and in spite of their rags and vermin
    they had forgotten their miserable condition, and already fancied
    themselves free. “I hope, gentlemen,” said M. Pic, “that when you
    pass through Buffarik on your return to Algiers, you will do me the
    honour of stopping to breakfast with me. Madame Pic will be extremely
    flattered by the compliment, and should any confusion reign in the
    meal, be so good, gentlemen, as not to attribute it to the slightest
    indifference on our part to the comfort of our guests, but to the joy
    which will no doubt disturb my wife, who of course believes me to be
    dead, and will feel considerable emotion at our meeting.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Gentlemen,” began M. Lanternier, “I will not be outdone; you must
    all give me the pleasure of your company at dinner at my village of
    Adel-Ibrahim. It is true, I am old, but to celebrate the day of our
    release I will take care that not even the youngest among you shall
    eat and drink more than I.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah ça</i>,” broke in Madame Laurent; “I trust, gentlemen, that I
    need not put up with the disgrace of being unable to offer you any
    civility. But first, I wish to know if there is a carriage road from
    Buffarik to Algiers.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Petite mère</i>,” answered the deserter, “you shall have a car whereon
    to make your triumphal entry into Algiers.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

  <p>
    “Be quiet you rogues,—I shall have the honour of receiving you at my
    canteen, and of offering each of you a glass of wine. The celebrated
    and unfortunate captives of the Bedouins shall have the privilege of
    drinking whatever they please gratis, like in the Champs Elysées on
    the birthday of Louis XVIII. I shall have the honour of waiting upon
    you myself, gentlemen; and I beg you to believe that my dress will be
    more carefully arranged and composed of better materials than it is at
    this present, most amiable and unfortunate captives of the barbarians.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Long live Madame Laurent!” exclaimed all the prisoners at once; “the
    amiable captives will all assemble at your canteen at Algiers.” “And
    at night,” added M. Lanternier, “we will all sup together with due
    honours.” “And you, Lieutenant,” said Madame Laurent turning to me,
    “will you do us the honour to be of the party?” “Certainly, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petite mère</i>,”
    replied I; “and long live Madame Laurent.”
  </p>

  <p>
    This is but one specimen of the conversations which continually arose
    on this subject.
  </p>

  <p>
    After taking a few turns on the terrace we returned to our house,
    and as soon as the evening began to close in, Bourgeois brought the
    kitchen fire into our room in a chafing dish, and one of the soldiers
    went to fetch our supper and oil for our lamp at the house to which
    he was directed by one of the Kait’s slaves; for the inhabitants
    of the town were forced to supply us by turns: meanwhile some of
    the party smoked, and others played at cards or chess with those I
    had manufactured. When we had eaten our kuskussu we called on M.
    Lanternier for a story, and listened with the deepest interest to Tom
    Thumb, Little Red Riding Hood, the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, or
    some other fairy tale, which he told with great fluency and grace. The
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">disciplinaire</i>, who had a very fine voice, sang Provençal songs with
    great taste and feeling. One by one we fell asleep, and thus ended our
    day.
  </p>

  <p>
    One afternoon our talk was interrupted by the noise of cannon and
    muskets, and of tumultuous voices. We went out to discover the cause,
    and were shocked at seeing the heads of fourteen slaughtered Spahis
    which the children were kicking about before the door of our house.
    They were afterwards put into a sack and sent to adorn Abd-el-Kader’s
    tent. This hideous spectacle made me sick.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 24th, two of the Italian fishermen, Crescenso and Francesco,
    arrived from Tekedemta: Berthoumiau had died of cold and ill usage,
    and had been buried there. The account of their sufferings was
    terrible. Their first enquiry was after little Benedicto, but the boy
    did not remember his friends or his country; only when they mentioned
    his mother Maria he seemed to feel some emotion and his memory to
    revive. “My mother,” said the boy, “is there,” pointing towards the
    tent of Abd-el-Kader’s wife; and away he ran to play with the Arab
    children.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> next day the Kait of Mascara announced to us that we were soon to
    proceed to Algiers, and that he had received orders from Abd-el-Kader
    to clothe us, which he accordingly did. The following morning we
    started amid the threats and insults of the women, children, and
    inhabitants of the town, and took Benedicto with us by force. The Kait
    had the cruelty to send Mardulin out of the way, so that we could not
    press the hand of one who had been our benefactor during our stay at
    Mascara.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had scarce left the town when the Kait ordered a halt and counted
    us over three several times: we were twelve Christian prisoners and
    three deserters: four of the prisoners were compelled to walk for want
    of mules, but were to ride by turns with the others. Together with
    several Jews and Arabs who had joined our caravan, we formed a body
    of forty, conducted by a Kait from the neighbourhood of Mascara, and
    guarded by one of Abd-el-Kader’s horsemen. The Kait then left us after
    having enjoined upon the chief of the escort to treat us well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon after mid-day we saw the village of El-Borgj, but we made a
    detour to avoid it, as it was market day, and the Kait feared we might
    fall victims to the hatred and fury of the assembled Arabs: as it was,
    the women and children came running towards us, and loaded us with
    threats and abuse. Towards night, after travelling over various hills,
    rocks and brushwood, through a savage and uncultivated country, we
    reached a little village at a few leagues from the falls of the Ouet
    Mina. The situation of this village at the foot of a mountain near
    several streams is delicious;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> rhododendrons, poplars, almond, fig,
    peach, and apricot trees, cover the whole plain, and the gardens are
    kept fresh and green by a plentiful supply of water.
  </p>

  <p>
    After some delay we were ushered into a sort of stable, and when the
    marabout had recited a prayer some excellent kuskussu was brought to
    us. We passed a bad night owing to the smoke. On the following day,
    in about four hours, we reached the village of a tribe on the banks
    of the Ouet Mina, where we procured some food: we then continued our
    journey towards the Schellif, avoiding the mountains inhabited by the
    Beni-Flitas who had shaken off Abd-el-Kader’s authority. After several
    days’ forced march over a rough country, the tired mules stumbling at
    every step and the men on foot suffering acutely, we reached a small
    village governed by an Aga of the plain of Milianah: we entered a
    large house in the public square, the inside of which was one vast
    hall, evidently intended for the reception of travellers.
  </p>

  <p>
    At one end mats were spread on the ground for our accommodation, at
    the other several Arabs sitting cross-legged on rich carpets were
    preparing coffee. Presently the slaves brought in some splendid
    cushions and a handsome divan, more magnificent than those belonging
    to Abd-el-Kader. The Aga, sumptuously dressed, entered, accompanied by
    our Kait, the young marabout, and several chiefs, and they began to
    drink coffee and smoke long pipes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went towards him and said that I was ill, and also a woman who was
    with us, and begged him to give us some coffee; upon which he not only
    ordered his slaves to bring us two cups, but sent Madame Laurent and
    Benedicto to his wife, who treated them with the utmost kindness.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hall which we occupied presented a most picturesque and striking
    scene. In one corner were the Christian prisoners sitting round a
    large fire, talking over their miseries and their sufferings, their
    livid faces plainly telling the torments they had endured: many were
    occupied in dressing their wounds and sores; occasionally plaintive
    murmurs and confused groans were audible from among them. A few paces
    from us, on gorgeous silken cushions, the Arabs reclined in a circle
    round the Aga, who looked like a Sultan in his splendid dress: these
    were drinking coffee and smoking. The flickering light made their
    pale faces look fiercer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> and wilder than usual. They were discussing
    the projects of Abd-el-Kader, and occasionally, when the conversation
    turned upon the Christians, their eyes flashed, rage deformed their
    countenances, and one might fancy that one saw before one some of
    those nomade tribes who in former ages overran Christian Europe,
    defiling the churches and monasteries by planting the crescent on
    their steeples and towers.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the hour of prayer the young marabout rose and recited it: the
    Arabs listened with deep devotion; and from my corner I gazed upon
    the strange and imposing scene. We then had some kuskussu and half a
    roasted sheep.
  </p>

  <p>
    This delicious repast and a good night’s rest greatly restored our
    exhausted frames, and we quitted with regret a village at which we had
    been so hospitably treated. Next day we reached Milianah. We received
    the usual treatment from the Arab populace, but were at length safely
    lodged in the house in which the Bey delivers judgment. The house
    consisted of three small rooms on the ground floor: in one of these
    the slaves prepared the Bey’s coffee; the second served as a prison
    for those Arabs who had taken arms for the French, some of whom
    were in irons, and others confined in circular blocks of wood which
    prevented them even from rising; the third room, which was dark, cold,
    and damp, was our prison. Our food was bad, and we suffered much from
    the exposure to damp and cold. Bourgeois, who until now had been in
    good health, fell ill, and our days were passed in rubbing him. The
    long journey too had irritated the wound of M. Pic’s servant, which
    began to be most offensive.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had been assured that we should start for Algiers after three days’
    stay at Milianah, and this had kept us from giving way to despondency.
    But when the time fixed for our departure went by, the future appeared
    to us in the most gloomy colours, despair seized upon our minds, and
    disease and misery wasted our bodies.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kait affected not to understand Abd-el-Kader’s directions, and
    ordered me to write to Algiers to announce the death of Meurice and
    Berthoumiau, and that two other Christian prisoners would be liberated
    in their stead. These delays drove us to despair, and we looked
    forward with impatience to the arrival of the Bey of Milianah, who
    might perhaps hasten our deliverance: but, he never came.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

  <p>
    In the midst of these torments we one day received the visit of a
    deserter, whose life and position among the Arabs are too curious to
    be passed over.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had seen this man before, but have delayed until now to mention him,
    in order to present this episode as a whole. While Abd-el-Kader was
    encamped on the borders of the Ouet Mina, a handsome man, dressed in
    the uniform of the Spahis, and without a bernouse, passed our tent,
    making his horse prance. The Arabs pointed him out to us, saying, “He
    is a Christian.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Shortly afterwards a negro came and told us that Moussa, the
    Christian, desired to speak with us. As we did not wish to have any
    dealings with deserters we told the negro that if Moussa wished to
    speak with us he must come here, as we were not free to go where we
    liked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scarce had the negro left us, when a tall man with a long flowing
    beard and an insolent bearing came to us, saying, “I am amazed that
    dogs of Christians such as you refuse to come when one so great and
    powerful as Moulin sends for you. Has not my fame reached you; and
    know you not that your fate is in my hands?” On my assuring him that I
    did not know him, he replied, “I am Moulin: four years ago I quitted
    the French, and I now command the armies of the Sultan. It is I who
    lead them to victory and carry terror and destruction into the ranks
    of the Christian dogs. I am he who returns from every battle with the
    heads of four Frenchmen whom I have killed with my own hand hanging at
    my saddle-bow.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “My dear Sir,” replied I, “you must imagine, to judge by your style
    of conversation, that you are talking to idiots.” “What do you say,
    you wretch?” “I say that our soldiers still believe in the existence
    of Moulin whose name even now inspires them with terror, for after an
    infamous desertion he was distinguished for courage. But he has been
    dead for years, and we do not believe in ghosts.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I tell you, dog of a Christian, that I am Moulin; I have taken the
    name of Moussa since I have become one of the faithful, and my power
    and authority know no bounds. I am now going to the tent of my friend
    Abd-el-Kader to determine your fate.”
  </p>

  <p>
    While this conversation was going on my poor friend Meurice, who was
    then alive, told me that he had attentively observed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> deserter’s
    features, and that they were familiar to him at Paris. He begged me
    next time he came to turn the conversation to Paris, in order that he
    might observe the impression this produced.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next day Moussa presented himself with the same presumptuous
    assurance; and after a great deal of vapouring on his part I asked
    him if he still persisted in passing for Moulin. “Dog of a Christian,
    you are most obstinate. Have not the French soldiers after a battle
    related that the Arab battalions were commanded by the terrible
    Moulin?” We then began to talk about Paris, in praise of which Moussa
    was most eloquent. “Do I know Paris?” cried he; “it is the place
    where I was born: and the theatres! I went to them every night, more
    especially to the Odeon.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “The Odeon!” said Meurice, with more heat than I had ever seen him
    exhibit. “The Odeon! You are an impostor; you are neither Moulin nor
    Moussa, but M——. I know you well. You used to come every evening to
    the director’s box at the Odeon: many’s the time you have sat on my
    knee as a child, and your sister was then a charming actress. My name,
    Sir, is Meurice.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Moussa was struck dumb at this vehement apostrophe, and Meurice
    continued, “I have never seen you since, but I have heard of you;
    you grew up a good-for-nothing fellow, and entered first the cavalry
    and then the infantry: in each your restless temper drew upon you
    the reprimands of your superiors; till at length you engaged in the
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bataillon d’Afrique</i>, and then in the Spahis, whose uniform you still
    wear. I heard of your desertion in the prisons of Mascara. You may
    call yourself Moussa, but your name before your infamous apostacy was
    the one I pronounced: I do not repeat it out of regard to your family.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I can deny nothing, Sir,” said Moussa, with despair painted in his
    face. “I am miserable; but believe me that it was only the vexations I
    endured which determined me to desert. I long resisted the unfortunate
    idea, but I could not bend to injustice; and if I have done amiss I
    now expiate my faults most cruelly.”
  </p>

  <p>
    We talked in this strain for some time, and Moussa appeared truly
    penitent, insomuch that we forgot his crimes and his impudence in our
    interest in his regrets and sufferings. From this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> time forward I
    did not see him again, as Abd-el-Kader presented him with a horse, a
    sabre, and a rifle, and sent him to the Hadjutes, among whom he had
    lived since his desertion.
  </p>

  <p>
    One day during my captivity at Mascara, Moussa came to visit me.
    I felt some pleasure at seeing him, and told him how miserable we
    were. He promised to do everything in his power, telling me that
    he commanded the cavalry of the Hadjutes, and that he was then on
    his way to Abd-el-Kader, whom he would press on the subject of our
    exchange. He added that he had saved some money, and hoped to escape
    to the coast of Spain. Meanwhile he sent me some bread and a shirt,
    which I accepted, as I imagined that he was still repentant. It so
    happened that during his absence a Hadjute had told me that he himself
    had, in the affair of the 3rd November, cut off the heads of three
    French officers of the Spahis, which I must have seen at Mascara.
    At this moment Moussa came to take leave of us, saying he had been
    able to do but little for us, but that on his return he would give us
    everything we could desire, as Abd-el-Kader would pay him handsomely
    for the three French officers whom he had killed, and whose heads he
    had sent him, adding that we should hear of him at Algiers, as he had
    written his name with the point of his sword on the back of one of the
    officers whose head he had cut off.
  </p>

  <p>
    We could not restrain our indignation on hearing this wretch
    invent lie after lie, and boast of the mischief he had done to our
    countrymen. After loading him with opprobrious epithets, we called
    back the Hadjute, and told him that Moussa boasted of having cut off
    those very heads which he, the Hadjute, claimed as his prize. “What!”
    exclaimed the Hadjute; “you say you have cut off the heads of the
    three officers? Moussa, you lie in your throat. <em>You</em> cut off the
    heads of Christians; you are a coward and a braggart. You fled when
    we encountered the Christians. You fled, dog that you are, although
    before the battle you boasted of your courage and prowess: you are a
    thief and a rascal.” Then turning to us, he said—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>“What! did he say
    he was going to the Sultan, to his friend Abd-el-Kader? His friend,
    indeed! The Sultan has sent for him, not to load him with favours,
    but to call him to account for the horse, the rifle, and the bernouse
    which he gave him, and which this fellow sold at Blidah, and then got
    drunk with the money.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Sooner or later I will have my revenge,” said Moussa, as we forced
    him out of our prison. A few minutes afterwards a negro brought me a
    letter from Moussa to the following effect:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “As I do not choose that a dog of a Christian, such as you, should
    keep anything that once belonged to so great and powerful a Mussulman
    as myself, I herewith command you to return by the bearer the shirt
    which I gave you yesterday. I am going to my friend Abd-el-Kader, and
    shall do my best to have your head cut off. At any rate, if I arrive
    too late to prevent your being exchanged, you will never see your
    friends, as I have given orders to have you all seized as soon as you
    have passed Buffarik.
  </p>

  <p>“Upon which I give you my word of honour.</p>

  <div class="rightinset mb2">
    “<span class="smcap">Moussa</span>,<br />
    <span class="small">“<em>Commander-in-Chief of the Sultan’s armies</em>.”</span>
  </div>

  <p>
    This letter excited the laughter of my companions, and we burnt the
    shirt which the rascal demanded in such insolent and haughty terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    We never saw the rogue again, but heard that the Bey of Milianah had
    sent him to Abd-el-Kader, under the guard of two soldiers, charged
    with several offences, and with having sold the horse, the bernouse,
    and the rifle, which had been given him by the Sultan, who, doubtless,
    condemned him to that death he so richly deserved for his various
    crimes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fast of Rhamadan at length induced the Bey to return to Milianah;
    but his presence brought no alleviation to our sufferings. Our jailer
    made the fast a pretext for depriving us of our daily allowance of
    boiled barley, and giving us nothing but half a barley cake each.
    The weather continued bitterly cold, with continual snow and sleet;
    and our dungeon was so dark that we were unable even to catch the
    vermin that infested it. We at length grew quite desperate, and most
    of us felt convinced that the Sultan had sent us to die of cold and
    hunger in the prisons of Milianah, and that he had never intended to
    release or exchange us. Fleury, Bourgeois, Crescenso, M. Lanternier,
    and the German servant, lay on the cold bare earth sick of the fever,
    and their groans and delirious ravings sounded most horrible in the
    darkness of our dungeon.
  </p>

  <p>
    One morning a canopy was raised in front of our prison: magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
    carpets were spread, upon which were laid cushions covered with
    gorgeous brocade; and before long the Bey came and seated himself upon
    them, in order to distribute the pay to his soldiers. Some slaves
    spread a large round skin of morocco leather at his feet, and emptied
    several bags of money upon it, after which the soldiers were called up
    by name, and each in succession received his pay.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mahadin-el-Hadj-el-Schir-ben-Moubarek Bey of Milianah, is a man of
    about forty. He is taller than Abd-el-Kader; his face is long, his
    eyes small, his lips thick, and his beard grizzled. He wore a haick,
    and a bernouse of beautiful crimson and azure cloth, embroidered with
    silk and gold, and ornamented with gold tassels. A superb yataghan
    glittered at his side. His officers, who stood in a row on either side
    of him, were all dressed in red vests and trowsers and white bernouses.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I perceived that the Bey did not cast a single glance upon our
    prison, and appeared to have forgotten our very existence, I came
    before him, with General Rapatel’s letters in my hand, and represented
    to him the misery we endured, and how opposed his cruel treatment of
    us was to Abd-el-Kader’s generous intentions. The Bey answered me
    with plenty of fine promises: he then departed, and we heard no more
    of him. At length a Hadjute came to announce that we were to start
    for the place at which the prisoners were to be exchanged, and in
    less than half an hour the list of names of those selected to leave
    Milianah that very day was brought to us. It included Madame Laurent,
    M. Lanternier, Crescenso, Francesco, Benedicto, and myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    The weather was terrible; a thick snow was continually falling.
    M. Lanternier was so ill that he was unable even to stand, and
    must infallibly have dropped dead from his mule in a few hours.
    We therefore resolved to leave him, and to take M. Pic’s German
    servant instead, who, though exceedingly ill from the effects of his
    wound, was able to sit upon his mule. We started amid the groans and
    lamentations of our fellow-prisoners, and the frantic complaints of
    Lanternier.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few days after our departure M. Lanternier sunk under his illness,
    and was buried outside the gates of Milianah.
  </p>

  <p>
    We stopped before the palace of the Bey, who was sitting in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> the
    court. He called me to him, and desired me to press General Rapatel to
    hasten the exchange of the other prisoners at the rate of three Arabs
    for every Christian. “If,” said he, “these terms are complied with, I
    will leave your outposts alone for a time; if not, my Hadjutes and I
    will not suffer them to rest in peace a single day.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Madame Laurent and Benedicto were waiting for us before the Bey’s
    palace: their condition had been very different from ours. They told
    us that the Bey had two charming daughters, whose kindness was equal
    to their beauty, and who had never ceased from paying them every sort
    of attention. At Madame Laurent’s request these amiable girls had
    frequently sent us provisions, but the slaves who were ordered to take
    them to us had eaten them themselves. We all mounted our mules except
    Crescenso, who was obliged to follow on foot, and we quitted the town
    amidst the jeers and yells of the populace, who shouted after us
    “There go the Christian dogs.”
  </p>

  <p>
    At length we were on our way towards home: the day of our release
    drew near; but this moment to which we had looked forward with so
    much impatience failed to excite in us the joy we had expected to
    feel. Sickness and misery had so completely exhausted our strength
    and spirits, that we could think of nothing but the sufferings and
    fatigue of the present moment. We travelled the whole of the day over
    mountains covered with ilexes, gum trees, and cypresses; the roads
    were detestable, and it never ceased from snowing. We made no halt
    until evening, when we arrived at a tribe in the mountains to the west
    of the plain of the Metidja. The Commander of our escort, one of the
    officers of the Bey of Milianah, conducted us to a mud hovel. A large
    fire was lighted, at which we dried our clothes, which were completely
    wetted by the snow. The Arabs of the surrounding tribes crowded to
    look at us, and to torment us with blows and abuse. They forced little
    Benedicto to repeat the Mahomedan prayer to every new comer, and
    the poor child had to say it at least two hundred times that night:
    they then commanded us to do the same, and beat us violently when we
    refused.
  </p>

  <p>
    The poor German, whose wound was gangrened, suffered most from the
    inhumanity of these people who kicked and struck him on his wound.
    We dared not remonstrate against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> wanton cruelty of these
    Arabs, who would have been too glad of a pretext to kill us all on
    the spot. After torturing us for about four hours they left us,
    and some detestable kuskussu was brought for our supper. I asked
    for some butter and honey to dress the poor German’s wounds, but
    it was refused. We lay down and endeavoured to sleep, but found it
    impossible; and Francesco and I lay concerting plans of revenge upon
    the Arab prisoners at Marseilles, and lamenting the hard fate of the
    companions we had lost.
  </p>

  <p>
    We left this inhospitable tribe before daybreak without breakfasting,
    on account of the Rhamadan. By eleven o’clock we had reached the plain
    of the Metidja, and our guide pointed out to us on the horizon the
    position of Algiers. This sight inspired me with fresh courage. I gave
    up my mule to Crescenso, who was weary with walking, and my haick to
    Francesco.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plain of the Metidja was covered with water; in many places it was
    up to our knees. My slippers were in a very bad state, and I soon left
    them sticking in the mud, and had to continue my journey barefooted.
    After a march of two hours we arrived at Blidah; our leader made us
    halt at the gates of the town, while he went to fetch the Hakem, a
    governor appointed by the French. But the Hakem was gone to Buffarik,
    to see whether the Arab prisoners who were to be exchanged for us had
    arrived, and the inhabitants of the town not only refused to allow
    us to enter it, but drove us away with blows and abuse; and the Kait
    of the Hadjutes sent us to the tribe of the Beni-Messaous, half way
    up the Atlas, where we remained two days exposed to every sort of
    ill-treatment.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of that time we were brought back to Blidah in perfect
    despair; we found that the Hakem had returned from Buffarik, and he
    received us with great hospitality. Madame Laurent and Benedicto were
    lodged with the Hakem’s wives; the other prisoners remained in the
    room in which we had been received at first, and the Hakem sent a
    chaous to invite me to sup with him. The cookery was very different
    from that in Abd-el-Kader’s camp, and for the first time I discovered
    that many of the Arab dishes, when well prepared, are excellent.
  </p>

  <p>
    After supper the Hakem retired, leaving the Kait of the Hadjutes and
    myself to sleep in the room where we had supped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span> I rolled myself in
    a rug and was fast asleep in a moment, but I was presently awakened
    by the Kait, who came and seated himself by my side, and tried to
    persuade me to desert my country and to remain with him. He offered me
    the usual inducements of fine horses, beautiful women, rich clothes,
    and splendid arms, and above all, plenty of powder. I was too tired to
    answer him anything but “Good night: do let me sleep.”
  </p>

  <p>
    At eight o’clock next morning the Hakem came in and asked me whether I
    was satisfied with his reception. On my answering in the affirmative,
    he eagerly pressed me to persuade the Governor to raise his salary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Three mules were prepared for Madame Laurent, the German, and
    Francesco, with Benedicto behind him: Crescenso and I followed on
    foot. This last journey was as fatiguing and painful as any previous
    one; it rained the whole day, and Benedicto cried with cold. As for
    us, the outposts of Buffarik were before us, and we felt nothing but
    joy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will not attempt to describe the reception I met with from my
    brother officers, nor my subsequent illness, nor how delightful it was
    to be nursed by my countrymen. Francesco, Madame Laurent, the German,
    and Crescenso were sent to the hospital at Algiers, where they lay
    ill for some time. The other prisoners were soon released, except
    the wife and daughter of M. Lanternier, and the two German women who
    are still in the possession of the Emperor of Morocco. I obtained
    Mardulin’s pardon, and contrived to communicate it to him: he escaped
    from Mascara with some orange merchants of Blidah, and is now enrolled
    among the Spahis.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I was on the point of embarking for France I heard myself greeted
    on the quay, and on turning round I saw Benedicto dressed in a new
    suit of clothes. “Where are you going, Benedicto?” said I. “To my
    mother Maria, who has sent me these fine clothes; I am going on board
    with Francesco and Crescenso to sail to Genoa, where she is waiting
    for me.”
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    On arriving at Marseilles, I hastened to visit the Arab prisoners,
    with the full intention of repaying them some of the cruelty I had
    endured from their countrymen. I however confined my revenge to
    inviting two of them to dinner: one, who was a mara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>bout, would not
    eat, because of the Rhamadan; but the other ate and drank wine and
    brandy like any Christian. He pressed me to return to his country,
    where he promised to give me quantities of horses and sheep, to
    receive me into his tent as his guest, and to watch over me while
    I slept. After dinner I took him to the theatre, and ended by
    conducting him home to his barracks and helping him to bed, for he had
    transgressed the law of the Prophet, and was drunk.

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

  works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
